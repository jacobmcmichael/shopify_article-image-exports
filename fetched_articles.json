Container gardening can provide flexibility, convenience, and the opportunity to grow plants in areas where traditional gardening is impractical. <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/garden-supplies/root-pouch-grow-bags/\">Root Pouch Grow Bags</a> take this concept to the next level.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So, why choose <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/garden-supplies/root-pouch-grow-bags/\">Root Pouch Grow Bags</a> for your potato-growing endeavors? The answer lies in their unique design and the benefits they bring to the table. These specialized fabric containers promote optimal root development, enhance aeration and drainage, and offer portability, making them an ideal choice for urban dwellers, renters, or anyone seeking a versatile gardening solution.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<h3><strong>How to Plant Potatoes in Root Pouch Grow Bags</strong></h3>\n<p>To plant potatoes, depending on the size of your container, fill it with 4 to 6 inches of prepared soil and place it in full sun. Your seed potatoes need a good bit of room to grow so be sure and get the correct plant spacing. For example, the <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-15-gallon/\">15 Gallon Root Pouch</a> can comfortably grow 4 potato plants and give the root structure plenty of room for a big harvest. We don’t recommend going smaller than 15 Gallon. The <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-45-gallon/\">45 Gallon Root Pouch</a> can grow 12, and the <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-100-gallon/\">100 Gallon Root Pouch</a> could grow 20-24 potato plants.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"770\" height=\"770\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg 770w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-600x600.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<h3><strong>Layering</strong></h3>\n<p>The same way that in-ground and raised bed planting requires hilling, container planted potatoes require the same treatment, called layering. To start, put in at least 6 inches of soil, but ideally 10 inches of soil into the bottom of the bag. Seed potatoes should be planted 6 to 12 inches apart and 3 to 6 inches deep. Press your potatoes into the earth as you plant them. Lightly cover your potatoes with 1 to 2 inches of soil. As the plant grows, you will continually add 1 to 2 inches of soil to the top of the plant as it grows to cover the new stems at the bottom until the container is full of soil.</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>Fertilization for</strong> <strong>Potatoes in Root Pouch Grow Bags</strong>\n</h3>\n<p>For a 15 gallon root pouch, fill ¾ with potting soil, add 5 cups of compost or worm castings and 1 cup <a href=\"/products/complete-organic-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hoss Complete Organic fertilizer</a>. Mix together. Then, every 10 days, mix 1 tablet each of <a href=\"/products/dr-joe-all-purpose-growing-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Joe All Purpose</a> and 1 tablet of <a href=\"/products/dr-joe-nutri-bubble-plant-food/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Joe Nutri Bubble</a> into 1 gallon of water. Apply as a drench.</p>\n<h3><strong>Irrigation </strong></h3>\n<p>Root Pouches drain VERY well. They will need watering every 2-3 days, if the weather is very hot, you will need to water every day. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"704\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag.jpg 704w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag-300x176.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag-600x352.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<h3><strong>Scratching &amp; Harvesting Potatoes</strong></h3><p>Potatoes can be harvested at different times throughout the growing season based on what you want. Scratching is a term used in gardening, meaning digging up a few of your potatoes before the ten-week maturity date. New potatoes refer to a fresh crop of potatoes that have just recently come out of the ground. You can harvest new potatoes but allow the rest of the plant to keep maturing. Simply dig up the potatoes you want, being very careful not to damage the ones still in the ground, bury the plant again, and water thoroughly. When at least 50% of the tops of the potato vines begin to die off and any flowers have begun to drop off, it’s a good indication that your potatoes are ready to harvest. </p><h3><strong>Curing &amp; Storing Potatoes</strong></h3><p>Much like onions, potatoes need to be cured after being harvested. It helps the skin thicken and let any slight damage heal and prevents bacteria from rotting the potato. Arrange your potatoes in a single layer in a well-ventilated area that is out of direct sunlight for a week to 10 days. Potatoes ideally should be stored around 55ºF and will last in storage for months on end. Warm temperatures will bring the potatoes out of dormancy and cause them to start sprouting. Sunlight will turn the potatoes green and should immediately be discarded. The green color comes from an excess of solamine and if eaten, can cause severe sickness.</p><div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ic8MH71WsIY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  ",
