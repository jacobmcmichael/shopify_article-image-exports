Container gardening can provide flexibility, convenience, and the opportunity to grow plants in areas where traditional gardening is impractical. <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/garden-supplies/root-pouch-grow-bags/\">Root Pouch Grow Bags</a> take this concept to the next level.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So, why choose <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/garden-supplies/root-pouch-grow-bags/\">Root Pouch Grow Bags</a> for your potato-growing endeavors? The answer lies in their unique design and the benefits they bring to the table. These specialized fabric containers promote optimal root development, enhance aeration and drainage, and offer portability, making them an ideal choice for urban dwellers, renters, or anyone seeking a versatile gardening solution.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<h3><strong>How to Plant Potatoes in Root Pouch Grow Bags</strong></h3>\n<p>To plant potatoes, depending on the size of your container, fill it with 4 to 6 inches of prepared soil and place it in full sun. Your seed potatoes need a good bit of room to grow so be sure and get the correct plant spacing. For example, the <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-15-gallon/\">15 Gallon Root Pouch</a> can comfortably grow 4 potato plants and give the root structure plenty of room for a big harvest. We don’t recommend going smaller than 15 Gallon. The <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-45-gallon/\">45 Gallon Root Pouch</a> can grow 12, and the <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-100-gallon/\">100 Gallon Root Pouch</a> could grow 20-24 potato plants.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"770\" height=\"770\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg 770w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-600x600.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<h3><strong>Layering</strong></h3>\n<p>The same way that in-ground and raised bed planting requires hilling, container planted potatoes require the same treatment, called layering. To start, put in at least 6 inches of soil, but ideally 10 inches of soil into the bottom of the bag. Seed potatoes should be planted 6 to 12 inches apart and 3 to 6 inches deep. Press your potatoes into the earth as you plant them. Lightly cover your potatoes with 1 to 2 inches of soil. As the plant grows, you will continually add 1 to 2 inches of soil to the top of the plant as it grows to cover the new stems at the bottom until the container is full of soil.</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>Fertilization for</strong> <strong>Potatoes in Root Pouch Grow Bags</strong>\n</h3>\n<p>For a 15 gallon root pouch, fill ¾ with potting soil, add 5 cups of compost or worm castings and 1 cup <a href=\"/products/complete-organic-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hoss Complete Organic fertilizer</a>. Mix together. Then, every 10 days, mix 1 tablet each of <a href=\"/products/dr-joe-all-purpose-growing-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Joe All Purpose</a> and 1 tablet of <a href=\"/products/dr-joe-nutri-bubble-plant-food/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Joe Nutri Bubble</a> into 1 gallon of water. Apply as a drench.</p>\n<h3><strong>Irrigation </strong></h3>\n<p>Root Pouches drain VERY well. They will need watering every 2-3 days, if the weather is very hot, you will need to water every day. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"704\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag.jpg 704w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag-300x176.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag-600x352.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<h3><strong>Scratching &amp; Harvesting Potatoes</strong></h3><p>Potatoes can be harvested at different times throughout the growing season based on what you want. Scratching is a term used in gardening, meaning digging up a few of your potatoes before the ten-week maturity date. New potatoes refer to a fresh crop of potatoes that have just recently come out of the ground. You can harvest new potatoes but allow the rest of the plant to keep maturing. Simply dig up the potatoes you want, being very careful not to damage the ones still in the ground, bury the plant again, and water thoroughly. When at least 50% of the tops of the potato vines begin to die off and any flowers have begun to drop off, it’s a good indication that your potatoes are ready to harvest. </p><h3><strong>Curing &amp; Storing Potatoes</strong></h3><p>Much like onions, potatoes need to be cured after being harvested. It helps the skin thicken and let any slight damage heal and prevents bacteria from rotting the potato. Arrange your potatoes in a single layer in a well-ventilated area that is out of direct sunlight for a week to 10 days. Potatoes ideally should be stored around 55ºF and will last in storage for months on end. Warm temperatures will bring the potatoes out of dormancy and cause them to start sprouting. Sunlight will turn the potatoes green and should immediately be discarded. The green color comes from an excess of solamine and if eaten, can cause severe sickness.</p><div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ic8MH71WsIY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  ",

But what happens to your drip tape after you've harvested your crops? Spending the money and time replacing your drip tape is not only costly but wastes hours that could be spent in the garden being productive. So we're going to show you the easiest way to save time and money and simply reuse your drip tape! If you aren't already utilizing drip tape irrigation, here are the main reasons to implement it in your garden.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Benefits Of Drip Irrigation In Your Vegetable Garden</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>Decreases pest and disease pressure naturally by keeping moisture off of the leaves</li>\n<li>Effectively provides the maximum amount of nutrients to the plant for a healthier overall crop</li>\n<li>Conserves water by delivering water and fertilizer directly to the root system, unlike overhead watering</li>\n<li>Cost effective because the drip system can be used in the same plot year after year without needing to replace it</li>\n<li>Aids in weed suppression. With overhead watering, areas of your garden are unnecessarily watered, which results in watering weed seed and germinated weeds that you don’t want to grow</li>\n</ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Step By Step Instructions For Reusing Drip Tape</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<ol>\n<li>Leave the drip tape attached to the <a href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mainline</a> tubing and move the drip tape out of the way. You can use a tool like the <a style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Hoss Double Wheel Hoe</a> with one of our weeding attachments to cultivate and remove any weeds from the area before replanting the next crop.</li>\n<li>Create a furrow using the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a> in the furrowing position to create a row for the drip tape. Lay the drip tape back in the garden with the emitters facing upward.</li>\n<li>Amend the furrow by laying good compost like <a href=\"/products/complete-organic-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hoss Complete Organic</a> down the row evenly and bury the tape using the Double Wheel hoe and switching the plow set to the hilling position. Once the drip tape is buried, we suggest turning the water on and letting the emitters seep out to indicate where to plant your seeds or transplants.</li>\n<li>Plant your seeds or transplants based on the recommended plant spacing and planting depth on the seed packet or the HOSS product page. Cover the seeds with dirt using a hoe or rake.</li>\n</ol><p>One exception is removing the drip tape off of some of the larger rooted crops like corn for example. After harvesting corn, you should cut the stalks down with a while they are still green. If the stalks are still green they dry up quicker and a few weeks later you can pull the drip tape up from the ground without damaging it. Then follow the instructions from the beginning. HOSS demonstrates the process in the video below.</p><div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\"

different spacing requirements, you may find that you need to move your rows. This is actually a very easy process if you have the right tools. If you purchased our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8 Mil Irrigation Kit</a>, or <a href=\"/products/15-mil-drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15 Mil Irrigation Kit</a>, you'll find in your package the it comes with <a href=\"/products/goof-plugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goof Plugs</a> as well as a <a href=\"/products/hole-punch-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hole Punch</a>. These are also available to purchase individually on the website if you need a spare. <br>To move the row, simply disconnect the drip tape from mainline tubing, plug the hole with the Goof Plug, punch a new hole using the Hole Punch, and reconnect the drip tape with the new configuration. Simple as that! </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"gallery-item\">\n\t\t\t\t<a data-elementor-open-lightbox=\"yes\" data-elementor-lightbox-slideshow=\"6c47da9\"

For example, if one season you plant tomatoes, you don’t want to follow it up the next season with tomatoes because the soil will be missing the specific nutrients those tomatoes need because the previous crop has already used those nutrients. Planting cover crops will add those nutrients back into the ground in between plantings. Cover crops make crop rotation less critical and give you more control over your soil. <br>In south Georgia where HOSS is located, we push our soil to the limits in the dead heat of summer. Summer cover crops are our go to solution for keeping our soil healthy between the Spring and Fall planting seasons. And because we don't have to fertilize or put cover crops on drip irrigation, you can save your resources for your cash crops in the main growing seasons.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Benefits Of Summer Cover Crops</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>Fixing atmospheric nitrogen and adding it to soils</li>\n<li>Building soils by adding organic matter known as “green manure.”</li>\n<li>Controlling erosion by reducing water runoff and nutrient leaching.</li>\n<li>Suppressing weed growth by providing a dense foliage canopy.</li>\n<li>Managing pests by reducing harmful nematodes and soil fungi.</li>\n<li>Attracting beneficial pollinators.</li>\n</ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Cover Crop Classifications</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p><strong>Monocots</strong> have a tall, upward growth habit similar to corn and have a fibrous root system.  <br><strong>Dicots</strong> tend to grow lower to the ground and have a deep tap root system.<br><strong>Legumes</strong> can be used as a cover crop that can also be harvested and are excellent nitrogen fixers.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Brown Top Millet</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Brown Top Millet is a monocot that works great to prevent soil erosion and suppress weeds. Many people like to use this cover crop as a livestock forage. Others will use it to create feeding plots for doves and other wildlife. Much like Sorghum Sudangrass, it is a taller cover crop and performs very well in the heat. It usually matures in 60 to 70 days.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1016\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2.jpg\" alt=\"Brown Top Millet\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2.jpg 1016w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2-600x403.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2-768x516.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1016\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1.jpg 1016w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1-600x403.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1-768x516.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h2>Sorghum Sudangrass</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Sorghum Sudangrass is monocot that contains a fibrous root system similar to corn. Sorghum Sudangrass will aerate and provide a significant amount of biomass for your soil. This cover crop is taller compared to other warm-season cover crops, and looks much like corn. It also provides a solid ground cover which will outcompete weeds and reduce further weed pressure.

It is the fastest-maturing warm-weather cover crops that we offer. Buckwheat will mature in four to six weeks. This crop is great for attracting pollinators such as bees because they absolutely adore this crop.

Iron Clay Peas have many benefits as a cover crop including nitrogen-fixation, weed suppression, and attracting beneficial insects.

They also have a very deep root system that helps to cycle and scavenge nutrients from the deep. They are also relatively drought-tolerant and perform well in the heat of summer when rainfall may be lower. These are really easy to grow on any scale, whether it be a raised bed or a few acres.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>SuperBee Phacelia</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Super Bee Phacelia is a nitrogen scavenger and has been reported to scavenge up to 15 to 20 units of nitrogen per acre. It has dense foliage which forms a carpet over the soil to retain moisture and prevent erosion. The dense foliage decomposes quickly once cut or tilled and adds carbon and organic matter to soils. Phacelia has also been noted to reduce harmful nematode populations by up to 30%. In milder climates, it can be grown as a fall/winter cover crop because it can withstand temperatures down to 18 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/products/super-bee-phacelia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1016\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia.jpg\" alt=\"Lacy Phacelia\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia.jpg 1016w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia-300x201.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia-600x403.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia-768x516.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h2>Summer Cover Crop Guide</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Still need help deciding which summer cover crop to use in your garden?

But what happens if you live in an apartment, only have a back porch, or just a small window ledge? Or what if your dedicated garden is already full of rows and rows of vegetables and you just don't have any more room to spare or don't want to add more growing plots, thus creating more work for yourself? The answer is simple - <strong>vertical and container gardening</strong>.\n<h2>The Benefits Of Growing Vegetables In Containers</h2>\nSmall space gardening has become so popular in recent years that the art of growing your own food in containers has been all but perfected. There have been varieties that have been specifically bred to be able to thrive in containers. With that and taking a plant's natural growth habit into account, container gardening is an excellent way to maximize your garden space or utilize whatever space you have available to you.\nAside from maximizing your space, growing food in containers gives you the benefit of protecting your plants during inclement or unexpected weather. If a late Spring freeze comes through, simply bring the containers inside until the threat of frost has passed. \nThe main things to remember when you're choosing container gardening is that it is always important to know <strong>what size container to use (roots need room to grow) and to make sure you have the right soil mix  (nutrients are key)</strong>. \n<h2>What Vegetables Can You Grow In Containers?</h2>\nTomatoes are by and large the most popular vegetable to grow in containers. However, there are so many other vegetables that you can add to the mix and produce plenty of food to harvest. Below are some of our favorite vegetables that will thrive in a container garden.\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- popup content -->\n<!-- badge content -->\n<!-- Thumb content -->\n<a

vegetables using vertical space as opposed to planting in the ground. There are a lot of ways to utilize extra vertical space to grow more food. Regardless of how much extra space you have, be it an extra window, a spare wall, you can maximize your indoor and outdoor space with trellises, hanging gardens, or a wall garden. Below are some DIY vertical gardens that we love. These ideas are just a few of the ways you can use simple materials to make an attractive vertical vegetable or herb garden.\n<h2>Best Vegetables For A Trellis Vertical Garden</h2>\nUsing a plant's natural growth habit is an excellent way to plan on using your extra space to create your vertical garden. Adding a trellis to a spare wall or at the end of your garden plot can increase your food supply greatly. Vegetables that have a climbing or vining growth habit like cucumbers, peppers, and pole beans are the perfect candidates to climb up those places that would otherwise go to waste in an everyday garden.

Preparing for the unexpected like food shortages, rising prices, and supply chain issues will ensure that even in the worst of times, you have what you need to thrive. While a lot of gardeners prefer to eat their crops fresh, preserving either a portion or the entire harvest for long term storage is what we recommend to feel secure in knowing that food insecurity won’t be an issue. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>A Few Things To Consider When Planning On What To Grow In Your Garden\n</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p><b><i>Diversity of the plant</i></b> <br>How many different uses can you get out of one crop? For example, corn can not only be eaten on or off the cob, but can be ground into cornmeal, used as animal feed, or sold at market for extra income.</p><p><b><i>How much space do you have to grow?<br></i></b> While there is a lot of information out there that tells you how much space you need in your garden to feed a person, there are many variables involved like the space requirements for plants, how much each family consumes, just to name a few. This is where planning comes into play. Choose the crops you want to grow, determine the space requirements and the yield for those crops and make sure that you get enough harvest to feed the number of people in your family using the charts, calculators, and planners below. <br><b><i><br>How many people do you plan to feed?<br></i></b>Obviously taking into account the people in your household, you also need to factor in those outside of your family. Are you planning on using these crops in a recipe during a dinner party? Do you plan on giving away some of your preserved food away as gifts to neighbors? If so, you may need to plan on planting some extra crops to account for those factors.</p><p><b><i>Do you have anything left over from last year’s harvest?<br></i></b>Having a bountiful garden is surely a great feeling but not having the space to store the crops you’ve grown is the quickest path to food waste. As a good rule of thumb, it’s a good idea to keep records of everything that you have in the freezer and pantry so that you can have a better idea of what you should be planting. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a data-gallery-index=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h2>How Much To Plant For Your Family</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Because of all the variables that go along with planning your garden, the chart below is simply a recommendation on how much to plant per person on average. Each family consumes different amounts of food, climates, soil, temperatures, etc., change from garden to garden so be sure to adjust these amounts based on your family's needs.

Adding flowers to your vegetable garden has a ton of long-term and short-term benefits from the blooms to the soil. Year after year in our gardens, we always make room for beautiful blooms. We've narrowed down our top 5 reasons that we always make sure and have flowers in our garden.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Reason 1: Bring On The Pollinators!</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>The first and arguably most important reason to plant flowers in your vegetable garden is to attract pollinators. A pollinator is an insect or animal that carries pollen from male plants to female plants to aid in fertilization. These critters are attracted to the flowers in your garden and will subsequently help to pollinate your nearby vegetables, helping to increase your yields and pollination rates. Even planting pollenless or low-pollen varieties like <a href=\"/?s=ProCut&amp;post_type=product&amp;post_type=product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ProCut Sunflowers</a> are still beneficial not only for their beauty but also for their nectar and keeping all those helpers coming back.</p><p>In short: pollinators are the rock stars of the garden and they absolutely LOVE flowers. So the more flowers, the better. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"768\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-768x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-600x600.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561.jpeg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"768\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-768x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-600x600.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966.jpeg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"768\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-768x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-600x600.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207.jpeg 1829w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-600x400.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Reason 2: Get Some Help With Weeds</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>In addition to attracting helpful pollinators, planting flowers densely can help suppress weeds in your garden by shading your soil from the sun. Keeping the sun off of your soil is extremely helpful with weed suppression because the shade that the flowers and foliage provide keeps those pesky weeds from being able to germinate. The root systems of the flowers are also usually quite a bit stronger than those of weeds so they will out-compete them with ease. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a

have been using different flowers as cover crops to help keep nutrients in the soil. In addition to that, planting flowers in spaces that would otherwise be empty in your garden will help with soil erosion, and help keep your soil from getting too compacted. <br>The real standout flower for helping your soil has got to be sunflowers. Depending on the size of your garden and how much space needs to be taken up next to your vegetables, there are so many varieties of sunflower that will suit your needs. If you have a smaller spot, the <a href=\"/product/sungold-dwarf-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sungold Dwarf Sunflower</a> is a perfect choice and if you have a crop of delicate lettuce that could use some protection from the scorching summer sun, you could try planting the absolutely stunning <a href=\"/product/firecracker-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Firecracker Sunflower</a>. <br>But what makes sunflowers so special in helping the overall health of your soil is their unique ability to siphon nutrients out of the soil that other flowers can't. Sunflowers have a really deep tap root and root system that can break into layers of soil and bring them closer to the top of the soil for other plants to use. They're also very salt tolerant so if you've found that your soil has a buildup of salt from either living near the coast or perhaps overusing fertilizers, planting sunflowers can help out!</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Which Flowers Are You Going To Grow This Season?</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCheck out our huge selection of flower seeds!\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/flowers/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h2>Reason 4: Share The Love!</h2>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-683x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-683x1024.jpeg 683w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-1365x2048.jpeg 1365w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-300x450.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-scaled.jpeg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<p>Sending flowers to your loved one for Valentine's Day or a beautiful arrangement as a get-well gift for a friend in need is inherently ingrained in all of us as a symbol of love, friendship, respect and so much more. <br>But to take that even a step further and present someone with a hand-picked bouquet of <a href=\"/product/beneficial-insect-wildflower-mix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fresh wildflowers</a> that came directly from your garden and into their hands can deepen that symbol even further.

That's great news but we know that deciding the best way to start can be overwhelming. Fear not, HOSS Study Hall is here to help. The two methods we explored were starting with a strawberry plant plug and bare root plant. Lucky for you, we've done our research and have determined that strawberry plugs reign supreme when compared side by side.\n<h2>What Is A Strawberry Plug?</h2>\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-300x400.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-600x800.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\n\n<strong>Plant Plug</strong> - Also commonly referred to as a set, is a live plant that arrives with soil already on its roots. Plugs can stay in their trays until ready to transplant into the ground.\n\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<strong>Bare Root</strong> - plants that are in a dormant state and have no soil on their roots on arrival. A good bit of special care needs to be taken with bare root plants when they arrive to protect the root system from damage.\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShop Our Hand Selected Strawberry Plants</h3>\n<a href=\"/product-category/plants/strawberry-plugs/\">\nClick Here\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h2>Strawberry Plugs Are Clearly Superior</h2>\nOne of the most compelling reasons for going with strawberry plant plug is financial. Whether you are a beginner gardener or a seasoned vet, when you invest in plants, the thought of them not producing can be a real heartbreaker on your wallet. On average, you will lose between 15% - 20% of bare root plants whereas plugs will usually only have a 1% - 2% loss overall. Because plugs arrive with soil already on the roots, they will usually establish a lot quicker, resist soil shock, and have an easier transition into dormancy when you're planting in the fall.\n\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/\">\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"148\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-768x148.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-768x148.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-300x58.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-1024x197.jpg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-1536x296.jpg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-600x116.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h2>Everything You Need For A Great Garden!</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"42481\" href=\"?add-to-cart=42481\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mortgage-lifter-tomato-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\">\nMortgage Lifter Tomato\n</a>\nRated <strong>5.00</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$3.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"42505\" href=\"?add-to-cart=42505\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/goldprize-squash/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/goldprize-squash-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/goldprize-squash/\">\nGoldprize Squash\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$4.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"42498\" href=\"?add-to-cart=42498\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/long-slim-cayenne-pepper/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/long-slim-cayenne-pepper-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/long-slim-cayenne-pepper/\">\nLong Slim Cayenne Pepper\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$3.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"112416\" href=\"?add-to-cart=112416\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/flash-collard/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/flash-collard-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/flash-collard/\">\nFlash Collard\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$4.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"55884\" href=\"?add-to-cart=55884\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/homestead-tomato/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/homestead-tomato-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/homestead-tomato/\">\nHomestead Tomato\n</a>\nRated <strong>5.00</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$3.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"57733\" href=\"?add-to-cart=57733\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/ghost-pepper/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ghost-pepper-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/ghost-pepper/\">\nGhost Pepper\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$4.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"45484\" href=\"/products/cosmos-sensation-mix/\">Select options</a>\n<a href=\"/products/cosmos-sensation-mix/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cosmos-sensation-mix-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/cosmos-sensation-mix/\">\nCosmos Sensation Mix\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$3.99</bdi> – <bdi>$14.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"208655\" href=\"?add-to-cart=208655\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/camaro-pmr-pumpkin/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/camaro-pmr-pumpkin-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/camaro-pmr-pumpkin/\">\nCamaro PMR Pumpkin\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$4.99</bdi>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pro Tip: Plant Your Strawberries In The Fall.

With bare root plants of the June bearing variety, you won't have a crop the first year. Once you put your plugs in the ground, fertilize and mulch them, they'll go dormant over the winter. As warmer weather rolls around and the plants come out of dormancy, you'll have a nice large crop of juicy, red, sweet strawberries over the course of a few weeks in Spring and early Summer.\n\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu8dDoVE5iM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe></iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  \n\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  ",

    "body_html": "<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Cucurbit Family</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of our favorite vegetable garden crops are in the cucurbit family which includes squash, cucumbers, winter squash, and summer squash. However, these cucurbit crops are the most susceptible to powdery mildew and downy mildew which are very harsh diseases in the vegetable garden. When temperatures start to rise up and we experience high humidity or moisture in the air that's when the powdery mildew begins to really affect the plants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What is Powdery Mildew?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A severe fungal disease that can really affect a wide variety of plants is powdery mildew. This powdery mildew is most commonly known to affect plants in the cucurbit, nightshade, and legume families. Once the fungus begins to take over control of one of your plants it will fill the plant with a layer of mildew made up of many spores along the top of the leaves. Those spores will then carry to other plants by the wind. If you've experienced powdery mildew in the past, new outbreaks come from dormat spores in old vegetative material or weeds nearby in the garden. Powdery mildew affects your plants by slowing down growth, reduce fruit yield, and the overall quality of fruits. Unlike other fungal diseases, powdery mildew thrives in warmer temperatures and dry/humid temperatures. In order to identify powdery mildew in your garden, it usually starts out as circular white spots on the top of plants but may grow on the undersides as well. Since young foliage is most susceptible you should ensure you have an effective pest control schedule early on in the vegetable garden to avoid any severe issues.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Treat Powdery/Downy Mildew</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If are experiencing this powdery and downy mildew disease on your plants, we highly recommend treating it with Bi-Carb Fungicide. This fungicide will disrupt the cell in the powdery mildew and will cure it. Another way to avoid powdery mildew in the garden is to plant cucurbit varieties that have disease resistance. Some of the older plant leaves are experiencing some downy mildew which starts out with yellow spots on the leaves. As the yellow spots get bigger they start to degrade the leaves and eventually create large brown rough spots on the leaves. To ensure our new growth does not experience the same issue we spray our new foliage with <a title=\"Complete Disease Control\" href=\"/products/complete-disease-control/\" target=\"_blank\">Complete Disease Control</a> and <a title=\"Liquid Copper Fungicide\" href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Copper Fungicide</a> in order to protect that new plant foliage. These fungicides are organic pesticides that can be used as a foliar spray which will effectively take care of the plant disease by spraying the top of the leaves. The most important way to ensure you have better success with controlling these diseases is to identify which disease is affecting your plants and begin to understand how you can control them in the vegetable garden. Once you identify these diseases you will be able to effectively kill off and overall control many diseases in your garden.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Growing Blue Bayou Pumpkins</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Along with his cucurbit varieties, Greg is growing some hybrid <a title=\"Blue Bayou Pumpkin\" href=\"/products/blue-bayou-pumpkin/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Bayou Pumpkins</a> that provide heirloom beauty with a strong disease package such as resistance to powdery and downy mildew. This pumpkin variety produces trailing vines that supply large 15-20 lb pumpkins. Their unique color profile consists of a light blue exterior with deep ribbing along the outer coating.

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:47:39-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Saving Time with Cherry Tomato Trellising</h2>\nAs the days are getting hotter and our tomatoes are growing taller, we try to answer the question of what is the most simple cherry tomato trellis. With cherry tomatoes having less foliage and smaller fruits, gardeners have more options on what they choose to support their tomatoes. Trellising, in its simplest form, is just supporting the plant as it grows. It is essential to do as your plants start to mature and need adequate airflow and space. Trellising also helps keep plants and leaves off of the ground to prevent fungal and bacterial diseases as well as insects. We see trellising used in many gardens with everything from melons to squash. Many gardeners understand the time it takes to manually weave a trellis through each plant, also known as the technique Florida weave. This method can be very time consuming as you have to do it multiple times as the plant continues to grow. Gardeners, especially those with larger gardens, will decide to turn to cattle fencing to skip all the hassle. Cattle fencing can be beneficial as it is easier to stake in the ground compared to the Florida weave. The downside of doing using cattle panels with cherry tomatoes or any smaller fruit for that matter is the lack of flexibility within the steel of the cattle fencing, which leads to breakage in the plant. One alternative to try with cherry tomatoes is the <a title=\"Hortonova Trellis Netting 59&quot; x 328'\" href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-59-x-328/\" target=\"_blank\">Hortonova Trellis Netting</a>. The Hortonova Trellis is described as a thicker fishing line and rolls out in a very manageable way. This trellis is as simple as cutting it to your desired length, zip tie-ing it to one side, and then stretching it tightly across the row and zip tie-ing it to the other side. You are allowing your plants to firmly grow vertically up the net while also having its flexibility without breaking the plant. Another tip when using netting to trellis your plants is to add posts every 10-15 feet and zip-tie the net there as well. Adding the extra support will allow your netting to stay upright and not sag with the weight of the fruits.\n<h2>Benefits of the Hortonova Trellis</h2>\n<p>The simple Hortonova trellis netting would be great to try on any cherry tomato variety such as The <a title=\"Sweetie Cherry Tomato\" href=\"/products/sweetie-cherry-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Sweetie Cherry Tomato</a> or The <a title=\"Black Zebra Cherry Tomato\" href=\"/products/black-zebra-cherry-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Zebra Cherry Tomato.</a> The Hortonova isn't made just for smaller fruits, though. It is strong enough to hold up even varieties of cucumbers like <a title=\"Diomede Cucumber\" href=\"/products/diomede-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\">Diomede</a> and <a title=\"Stonewall Cucumber\" href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\">Stonewall</a>, as well as the <a title=\"Kentucky Blue Pole Bean\" href=\"/products/kentucky-blue-pole-bean/\" target=\"_blank\">Kentucky Blue Pole Beans</a>. Even though the netting with the cucumbers might sag a tad bit when they are getting ready to harvest compared to the cherry tomatoes or pole beans, the netting allows you to stretch it as tight as you can to prevent the fruit from being on the ground. Though the netting does hold up great even on heavier cucumbers, we suggest to not use this Hortonova trellis netting on butternut squash or any heavier winter squash because it isn't quite strong enough. For smaller fruits like our cherry tomatoes, this netting works perfectly. The netting comes in various lengths, but there are benefits with having the longer roll as it can never go bad. The Hortonova trellis is sold on the website up to 328 feet long. Another bonus about this netting is its UV resistance, so it will never deteriorate in the sun but rather can be used year after year. Check out the video below to see exactly how to set up this simple cherry tomato trellis. Also, be on the lookout for videos in the future to see just how well this trellis held up with the different cherry tomato varieties.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uu-9DX4XzOM?si=JiLIEEgr83n7s-lK\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:47:09-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>When Should I Start Digging my Potatoes?</h2>\n<p>Irish Potatoes are one of the most maintenance-free crops, but the big question is, how do I know when my potatoes are ready? Digging potatoes is the hardest part about growing a potato plant. You will know it is the right time, though when the vines start dying back, and the weather is consistently warm and dry. If you dig your potatoes up and there is no disease set up on them and only one or two rodded potatoes, you know you tug them up at the correct time. Another thing to check for to determine if it was a good harvest is to see if they are all consistent in size. For differing varieties, this will change, but if you have the same variety planted on a row, then you want all of them to be about the same size. If you have some that were small in one area that may be a sign of poor soil or lack of water, you want to check this out, so you are ready for the next time you plant.  Making sure that you have good potatoes to dig up, starts with your soil. The best potato growing soil is excellent and sandy, leaving room for your potato roots. It doesn't stop there though potatoes aren't complicated and will be well worth your money as long as you make sure to take care of them once they are in the ground. You can do this by keeping plenty of water on them, fertilizing when needed, and hilling them a couple of times. </p>\n<h2>The Best Potato Varieties to Grow </h2>\nDigging Potatoes is all fun and games but you can't get there if you don't pick the perfect variety to plant first. Potato plants come in all shapes and sizes, and it is always fun to grow the right mix of all of them. Our four most successful varieties of potatoes are listed below. \n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Red Norland Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Norland</a> is the first to pop up out of all the potatoes in your vegetable garden. This potato is a hybrid of the traditional red potato. Still, it has a darker red skin that has a high disease resistance to scab, Rhizoctonia, and potato virus. The Red Norland can be grown in many different climates and produces heavy yields. Its white flesh is excellent for steaming and boiling, which makes it perfect for a low country boil! </li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Yukon Gold Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yukon Gold</a> potato is probably our tastiest potato and the next one to come out of the garden with a 100-day maturity rate. Its tan skin and light brown flecks with a bright yellow flesh will leave you no need to butter these melt-in-your-mouth treats. Yukon Gold Potato produces heavy yields of medium to large-sized potatoes that are slightly elongated. This variety is known for its versatility in the kitchen for frying, baking, mashing, roasting, and more!</li>\n<li>This next variety produces potatoes with dark, reddish-purple skins and a vibrant, deep purple flesh. The <a href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\" title=\"Adirondack Blue Potato\">Adirondack Blue Potato</a> is purple in flesh and rich in antioxidants. The crop is medium to large with about an 85-day maturity rate. The Adirondack Blue potato keeps its color when cooked, leaving you tons of fun in the kitchen making blue mashed potatoes or potato salad!</li>\n<li>Our <a href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"German Butterball Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">German Butterball</a> is a late-season variety, blue-tag certified, and has excellent storage capability. It has a golden-yellow flesh that will melt in your mouth! When given the time to reach full size, they are delicious but also work great as baby potatoes for canning or pot roasts. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch the video below to see Greg dig these four varieties up. If one of these doesn't seem to be quite what you are looking for, check out our website to see all the potatoes we offer.</p>\n<div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N92gg5AtXbk\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:47:05-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>All About Tomato Growing</h2>\nAlmost everybody's favorite thing to do in the vegetable garden is tomato growing, but did you know tomatoes are a fruit! Tomatoes come from the ovary of a flowering plant, making it a seed-bearing fruit. Others like this that we usually classify as vegetables are eggplants and peppers. Tomatoes are a favorite item in the garden because of their excellent taste; they are delicious. Like many crops, there are two different types of tomato seeds, heirlooms, and hybrids. Heirlooms are original seeds that have not been altered in any way. They are passed down from generation to generation, and many families like to continue on that tradition of growing them. Some even want to rely on them instead of the hybrids, at Hoss Tools we have a few heirloom tomato varieties such as,\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/homestead-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Homestead Tomato\">Homestead Tomato</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/brandywine-pink-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Brandywine Pink Tomato\">Brandywine Pink Tomato </a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/boxcar-willie-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Boxcar Willie Tomato\">Boxcar Willie Tomato</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/black-krim-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Black Krim Tomato\">Black Krim Tomato</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mortgage Lifter Tomato\">Mortgage Lifter Tomato</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hybrids are cross-pollinated seeds to help produce extra fruit and to have higher disease and pests resistances. Everyone has their preference on which seed variety they prefer, and for us here at Hoss Tools, we have found that variety to be the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bella Rosa Tomato\">Bella Rosa Tomatoes</a>. They are a pelleted see, and you can count on those for production because they are that hybrid seed. Two other tomatoes that are great hybrids and determinate tomatoes are the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/mountain-glory-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mountain Glory Tomato\">Mountain Glory</a> and the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Brickyard Tomato\">Brickyard</a>. All three of these have that disease resistance as well as delicious fruit. Most people don't grow tomatoes because they are easy. After all, they are quite the opposite. Tomato growing takes time and loving on but is well worth it when they are ready to eat. Tomatoes have a longer maturity rate, so they do better if they start as transplants as that takes about two weeks off their harvest-ready time. Your plants are going to need a lot of nitrogen and fertilizer. They also need some support when they are starting to mature and need help standing up. There are many options for this, such as the Florida weave, hog panels, and the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-59-x-328/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hortonova Trellis Netting 59&quot; x 328'\">Hortonova Trellis</a>. Trellising will help them from getting blown over and will keep your fruit off the ground to prevent insects.</p>\n<h2>The Best Tomato Sandwich</h2>\n<p>Though tomatoes aren't the most expensive fruit, there is something about eating one that you grew yourself. That gratification of being self-sustaining is such a great feeling, and here at Hoss Tools, we want to help you achieve that and enjoy the groceries you are making in your garden, so here is one of our favorite tomato recipes. Once your tomatoes have grown right up, and you have been fertilizing them real good, you are going to get a big beefsteak type tomato that is perfect for slicing. It has excellent flavor and is fruitful; once you pick your harvest, it is time to put those groceries to the test. The recipe right here is a Mr.Greg Hoss special recipe and his favorite thing to do once his tomatoes are ready. First, you want to get you two pieces of fresh light bread and smear you some mayonnaise all over both sides. Then you want to take your good ripe tomatoes and slice it up into pieces for the bread. Once you have a good bit of tomato slices, you should layer them all over one part of the bread. After you have your desired amount of tomatoes, then you want to sprinkle you some pepper and salt on both sides. Then slap your two pieces together, and that is what Mr.Greg calls one of the best meals ever, even better than a payday!!

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Best Potatoes to Plant</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Potatoes are one of the easiest things to plant in your garden as they do not need much uptake to produce, but fertilizing potatoes is the way to go if you want to take your yield to the next level, and that can get a little tricky. As the days in South Georgia are getting longer, it is getting into tater time, and Hoss Tools wants to help you navigate through growing and fertilizing your potatoes. Nothing beats going out and scratching you a potato to take inside and boil up for dinner. So how do you get your crop to that point?</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">First, we need to talk about getting them in the ground and what should be in your soil. There are many different varieties you can grow, everything from </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/all-blue-potato/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"All Blue Potato\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">All Blue</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> potatoes to a general </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Yukon Gold Potato\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yukon Gold</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Your method of planting is going to be around the same for all Irish Potatoes. In regards to your soil, potatoes like to live anywhere from 5-6.5 pH level, so you want to make sure you have plenty of that organic matter in there. When planting potatoes, we suggest you plant them four to six inches apart with a 36-inch row spacing. The spacing will give them ample room but also keep them close enough together, so your rows aren't too spread apart.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With all crops, it is imperative to have you a good crop rotation so that you don't soak all that nutrients up out of the soil. Figure out a plan for what you are going to plant before and after your potatoes to make sure you are a good steward of your soil. Make sure to remember that potatoes are in the nightshade family, meaning it isn't healthy to plant where other nightshades have been like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant. Look out for sandy soil to know that you may not have suitable growing soil anymore and figure out how you can add nutrients back into it.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fertilizing the Potatoes</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is essential to fertilize your potatoes once they are in the ground and throughout the weeks. Though potatoes don't have many pests, they do struggle with a little bit of Blight and the Colorado Potato Beetle here in the south. That Colorado Potato Beetle, you have to look for eggs that might be waiting to hatch under the leaves. One way to fight against that is to alternate between </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Spinosad Garden Insect Spray\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spinosad</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/neem-oil/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neem Oil\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Neem Oils</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which are both insect sprays. Rotating weeks and starting while their young as well as making sure that you are spraying under the leaves and getting good coverage will help you see success in your potatoes.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once your plants are in the ground, there are a few things you can do to make sure that you are getting the most bang for your buck. In a cup, you are going to want to mix a 10-10-10 synthetic fertilizer and pour it down in the roots of the plant. The benefit of this fertilizer is that it will help boost your yield to the next level as well as gain that resistance to pests and diseases. Once you do that once with the cup when it is young, you should go in there again, but wait until they are at your desired height of four to eight inches tall. That will continue to help the plant as it matures.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Though potatoes aren't expensive in the grocery store, we want everyone to be encouraged to grow their food! Gardening is a family activity everyone can enjoy and reap the benefits.

There is all kind of seeds out there, and here at Hoss Tools we have many varieties of both, and it just comes down to your preference. Field peas have more of the bean taste, whereas the English varieties are the traditional sweet green ones. We have started to enjoy growing the Summertime Pinkeye field pea, though, because the crop grows at the top, it is effortless to harvest also, this variety is easy to shell. They are a purple pull, but its a green pea that creates a clear broth.

Looking at the size of your seed and seeing which seed plate you are going to use is critical because if the hole is too big, you may end up wasting seed or jamming the plate. Planting on drip tape is also very beneficial with peas in helping to conserve water. You want to harvest your crop when they look full and like they could be shelled easily. Depending on the variety, they will be anywhere from four to eight inches in length. Most varieties have an average of about 60 days until maturity. Meaning that in about two months after you plant, you will be ready to have some black-eyed peas for dinner.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ways to Preserve</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After harvesting your crop, there are going to be way more than you can eat, if you plant a lot as we do. Though we always suggest sharing with your friends, there are also many ways to make sure they don't go bad. A couple of different ways you can preserve the pea itself is to freeze them, salt them, dry them, or canning. You can also maintain the whole pod by freezing or salting. Dried beans store very well and can get rehydrated for those special occasions. Black-eye peas are also a great addition to fresh salads and soups. These different ways will help you keep your crop good and fresh until you are ready to cook them!</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you want to know more about the Hoss garden seeder or growing your food, even if it is not peas, check out the video below!</span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wwx0VvVcHSI?si=1GS9ruB-MWtQJS_u\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"></div>",

Well, in no time, we mean at least 80 days. As always, the first step in planting anything is choosing which variety you want to work. There are many seeds out there, and Hoss Tools offers many different varieties that meet the wants of every sweet corn eater. Some of the top three here are the </span><a title=\"Silver Queen Sweet Corn\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/silver-queen-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Silver Queen</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a title=\"Ambrosia Sweet Corn\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/ambrosia-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ambrosia</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, and this year even the </span><a title=\"Honey Select Sweet Corn\" href=\"/products/honey-select-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Honey Select Sweet Corn</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Honey Select is a triple sweet variety and is an All-American winner. The ears grow to be around eight inches, which is a giant ear. Honey Select Sweet Corn is a triple sweet hybrid that contains the perfect combination of 75% sugary-enhanced and 25% super sweet kernels. Many people enjoy this variety because of its big window, for when you have to harvest it, this is due to its field holding ability. It also stores very well in the freezer, giving you many options when it comes time to cook it. Some of our favorite ways to cook it are eating it off the cob, making cream corn, and as always sharing it with our friends.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sweet corn does best when planted in the spring after the last frost date. Sweet corn can be grown throughout all of the warmer months as long as you have time to harvest it before the first frost. Hoss Tools recommends succession planting with sweet corn, and what that means is after you gather it, you go in and plant you some more rows where you just had it. Most small scale farmers do at least two plantings first in the early spring, then in the late summer.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Garden Seeder Tips</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When it comes time to planting the sweet corn and getting your plots ready, it is essential to remember to plant in blocks and not long rows. We suggest planting corn in a square plot with rows on 30-36″ spacing. Planting a few long rows will result in poor germination and the absence of kernels on the cobs. The reason behind this is because unlike most plants, corn pollinates by the wind and not by the bees.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After you have your plots ready, we suggest you go in with a walk-behind planter like the </span><a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hoss Garden Seeder</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> using the number 4 seed plate so that your seeds are 4 inches apart and you want to plant one inch deep. Another beneficial tip when planting corn is doing it on drip tape. The drip tape helps get the water throughout the roots avoiding diseases on the foliage. If you do decide to lay drip tape, then you are going to want to plant right on the lines of the tape to make sure the water reaches it. Doing the seeder at a one-inch depth will make sure it doesn't puncture the drip tape.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once your seeds are all planted, you want to go in and give it a good watering immediately. If you are on drip tape, leave it turned on for about an hour. This water will help the seed to lock in good. Now that you are all set with your plant, keep a good eye on them for the next 80 days, and soon you will start to have some groceries out in the field.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you found this blog helpful, tune in to the video below to see these tips on growing Honey Select Sweet Corn in action on Gardening with Greg!</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/raA9IQllZ2Y?si=tZoPrUfsb2YK2Z1r\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"></div>",

There are many watermelon tips out there, so we need to start from the beginning, the seed. With almost all plants, there are two choices, Hybrid or Heirloom. An heirloom seed is one that has not been altered but past down many generations. Most Heirlooms originate from families in the 1800s including some of Hoss tools favorite watermelon varieties such as</span>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/charleston-gray-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Charleston Gray </span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/georgia-rattlesnake-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Georgia Rattlesnake</span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/moon-and-stars-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moon and Stars</span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/sugar-baby-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sugar Baby</span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/tendersweet-orange-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tender Sweet Orange</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The other option when choosing a seed is Hybrid varieties, and many people choose these because of there likelihood to produce a higher yield. The cross-pollination of the same plant produces a hybrid seed but different varieties. Hybrids are one of the main contributors to the rise in agricultural output in the last century. Not only do they usually produce a higher yield, but they can also have other benefits such as being sweeter. It all just depends on your style of gardening and what you like to eat. Hoss Tools also offers many Hybrid varieties, including </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/crimson-sweet-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crimson Sweet</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which is an All American variety.

You can either direct seed or transplant, and there are benefits to both, but here at Hoss Tools, we recommend transplanting, and here is why. Watermelons take about 85-95 days to mature and starting them off in a seed tray, and then transplanting is going to give you about a two-week head start of everybody. Transplanting can be vital if you are a small scale market farmer because you can get to selling them before everyone else does. Also, for out friends up north that have a smaller growing season, this transplanting method will make sure you have plenty of time to harvest your watermelons. When you see your seeds have started to get nice good leaves on them and are strong enough to pull up the roots, then you know it is time to put them in the garden.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When you are planting your transplants into the ground, you want to make sure they are far enough apart to give them plenty of room. Watermelons grow in a vine-like structure, making them spread out on the ground needing plenty of room to grow. Another thing to consider with watermelons is the dense cover they create, making it harder to get water down to the root system. You want to make sure you are watering under the leaves to prevent diseases on the foliage. Deciding to use drip irrigation could take your crop to the next level.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One last tip to make sure you are getting the most out of your crop is to make sure you have plenty of pollinators. Lack of pollinators is usually the reason for many problems in people's home gardens if you can't get bees nearby plant you some cut flowers in your garden to draw you some insects to get the flower turning in to fruit.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hopefully, these simple watermelon tips will help take your garden to the next level, check out the video below to find out some more tips!!</span>\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTsUp_diE6E?list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=23\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>",

    "title": "Help your Garden Soil with these Three Tips- All about Tillage",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:47:02-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>How to Know if your Garden Needs Help</h2>\n<p>Soil is the main ingredient in every great garden, and you have to understand the tillage of your soil to be able to help your garden. So what is good tillage? Tillage is the suitability of your soil to grow. Characteristics of good soil are that it will crumble in your hand while also having large pieces. It will have lots of organic matter and hold nutrients and water well. You will know if it is bad soil or not suitable to grow in if it has a powdery look or it doesn't hold nutrients and water well. Another thing to look for when trying to spot lousy tillage is if there is an impacted or crusted layer on top. That layer will cause water not to soak in, making the nutrients die down. We all want to be good stewards of our soil, and growing a garden is doing just that. If your soil is not suitable to grow, then how can we be good stewards? These next few steps will help your soil become nutrient-rich and help you produce the most amount of fruit.</p>\n<h2>Tip 1 to Help your Garden- Make it Organic.</h2>\n<p>The first important step in helping your garden has good soil is making sure it has plenty of organic matter in it. The main way many people do this is by adding compost. Compost can be any organic matter that has decomposed, you can start your compost pile, or you can get manure. Both of those ways will help boost your soil nutrients and the overall tillage of your soil. We take and take from our garden, but we have to remember that we must feed our earth as well to make sure we get the most out of it.</p>\n<h2>Tip 2-Change it Up</h2>\n<p>Crop rotation is significant in all scales of gardening/farming. Another way to add nutrients to the soil is by having those cover crops before you plant. Do your research on what type of cover crop will be best for your soil. For a garden that is still really lacking that nutrients, we suggest that you do a mix of <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/winter-rye/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Winter Rye\">Rye</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Buckwheat\">Buckwheat</a>. Those two will add the most organic material back into the soil. All soils are different, though, and a lot of it depends on your weather. There are many cover crops out there, and if you mix the right ones, you can get the most out of your soil. Also, know what crops you planted in that plot the season before to make sure you're not planting the same species. If you continue to plant the same family in the same place, it will use all of those specific nutrients that family needs leaving the next ones to die. That is why it is essential to have a cover crop in between two crops. Doing that will make sure your soil is getting replenished. </p>\n<h2>Tip 3-Do Not Beat your Soil.</h2>\n<p>When we say don't beat your soil, we mean it. One big thing that hurts your garden that many people don't realize is over tilling it. When you continue till after it is needed, it continues to break up the soil making it harder for the soil to hold water and the nutrients it needs. After you cut down your cover crop, you can till it in one good time then use your <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes?filter.v.price.gte=&amp;filter.v.price.lte=&amp;filter.p.tag=Bundles&amp;sort_by=best-selling\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wheel Hoe Bundles\">wheel hoe</a> to get the soil ready. You don't want to cultivate your soil with the tiller but with something else instead of the wheel hoe. That over tilling is where you get the powdery look, and when you are continuing to break it up after it's needed, it will cause long term problems. Check out the video below to see the effects of over-tilling!!</p>\n<div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NugpHCHxU6U\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Something New in 2019- SEEDS</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As we are continuing to expand here at Hoss Tools, we want to meet the everyday needs of our customers. That has to lead us to the decision to start selling new seeds! We have been trying to answer the question of what can we offer that others cannot? After much research and deliberation, Hoss Tools came to the idea of providing our customers with the full package. We are excited to offer not only the tools to help our customer's gardens grow but now the crop itself. We are truly living out our purpose of helping everyone grow their food.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At our warehouse in Norman Park, Georgia, we have added a seed facility to help us meet this new demand. The facility is climate and humidity-controlled. The seed room will help us hold on to the germination of them as well as keep their shelf life as long as possible. We are keeping the climate at 60 degrees and the humidity at 40% so that pests and insects can't grow on our product. This controlled room also helps us keep our seeds dry, which again helps increase the shelf life. We are different from the many competitors that are keeping seeds outdoors or just in a basement, which decreases the vitality of the plant. With all our products, we want to give you the best opportunity once it is in your hands, and that is no different with our new seeds.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Why Hoss Tools?</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As we decided to venture down this new product line, we knew we wanted to put the best out there. We have decided to focus on giving our gardeners many unique hybrid seeds that will help you produce the most crop. Many farmers have access to these seeds, but they are very hard to find for small scale market farmers and others. We want to be a place that you can get seed to grow any crop you'd like, even the ones that you can't find on just any shelf. Some of those include,</span>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bella Rosa Tomatoes\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bella Rosa Tomato</span></a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/blue-bayou-pumpkin/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" title=\"Blue Bayou Pumpkin\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Blue Bayou Pumpkin</span></a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/jimmy-red-corn/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jimmy Red Corn\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jimmy Red Corn</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/yellow-moon-and-stars-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Yellow Moon and Stars Watermelon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yellow Moon and Stars Watermelon</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">All of these hybrids, along with many others we will be offering, offer high disease and pest resistance and will help flourish your garden. One other big thing Hoss Tools wants to focus on to give you the best product is its packaging. On every seed packet, there will be a picture of the crop, the number of seeds, and the germination rate. It is vital to have all of this on the packet, so the customer knows what they are buying. We are also offering packaging in many sizes, and if there isn't a size on the website that fits your needs, all you have to do is call, and we will pack to order. Same-day shipping will be offered with our seeds so that every person who orders seed on our website will have it in their hands and gardens as soon as possible.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hoss Tools is continuing to grow and will continue to expand the seeds we will be offering.

Irish Potatoes are in the nightshade family along with tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers. Having a good crop rotation is vital, and you need to remember not to plant your potatoes where these were before. Being cautious of this will make sure your soil stays nutrient-rich for many years to come.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another way to help your crop rotation is to plant cover crops in your offseason. Mustards are a great cover crop to prepare your soil for potatoes. About three or four weeks before you are ready to plant your potatoes, you are going to want to go into that mustard plant and cut it down and till it in the soil, so it has time to decompose before you plant your potatoes.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To know when you want to plant your potatoes you are going to have to check your local weather station and see when they predict the last frost to be, once you get that date go back and plan to plant two to three weeks before that. For us in South Georgia, that usually means late February will be ideal planting time for our Irish Potatoes, but it can vary every year.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Growing the Perfect Potato</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many different varieties of Irish Potatoes you can plant for beginner gardeners trying to figure out which plant works best for you, and your soil is a challenging task. Try planting three or four different varieties in one row each right by each other and compare which ones do best in your soil. Remember, you want to plant potatoes in the highest and driest part of your plot to avoid rot.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When you have your variety, and it is about four days out before you want to start planting, get your potatoes and an excellent sharp-bladed knife ready. You are going to want to cut three to four eyes per piece, this does not have to be perfect, but we find having around three or four eyes do the trick. As you are cutting and determining how many pieces to cut, think that about every 40 foot you will need around ten pounds of potato pieces.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As you finish cutting your pieces, you are going to want them to sit out for about three to four days. As they sit out the flesh will seal over and prevent moisture from going in or out, doing this again will help you from getting rot in your potatoes. After those few days pass, you are all ready to plant your pieces in the ground!</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Irish Potato Varieties</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Yukon Gold Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yukon Gold Potato</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"German Butterball Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">German Butterball Potato</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/all-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"All Blue Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">All Blue Potato</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Adirondack Blue Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Adirondack Blue Potato</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/kennebec-white-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kennebec White Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kennebec White Potato</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/french-fingerling-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"French Fingerling\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">French Fingerling</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/austrian-crescent-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Austrian Crescent Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Austrian Crescent Potato</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Red Norland Potato\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Red Norland Potato</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Check out the video below to answer some of your questions and to see this process in action!!</span></p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvlEJvk9oMk\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

Sunflowers, especially the ProCut variety, are a beneficiary to any garden by attracting pollinators. Not only do they draw the pollinators, but they will also add beneficial insects, which will reduce the harmful pest pressure to the rest of the crops.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ProCut sunflowers are the preferred sunflower variety for the cut flower industry. These sunflowers also make beautiful additions to any cut flower bouquet. Growing six to seven feet tall, this single, smaller stem with a big head makes for a perfect vase. They are also pollen-less, meaning that once you take it inside, it's not going to drip pollen anywhere.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One tip many flower growers don't know is your flowers are ready to go inside before you realize. To get the highest storage potential, harvest your blooms when they are still closed or slightly open. Once the flowers get cut and go in the water, they will stay big and bloomed for up to a week compared to the usual two or three days.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grow the Best Sunflower for your Garden</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ProCut Sunflowers can be direct-seeded or transplanted.

Just make sure that you choose the right seed tray because, with some variety packs of seeds, the size may vary.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunflowers also produce well by transplants. Using a seed starting tray, you can make sure they are taken care of and root properly before inserting in the ground. You will know your transplants are ready to go in the field when you can easily pull them from the tray, and they stay together.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When planting ProCut Sunflowers, you will find they grow well in double rows with drip irrigation. To maximize your garden space and to get the most out of your drip tape, you can lay one row down and then plant on both sides. If you would like your sunflowers to grow with big heads and talk thick stalks, we suggest planting with plenty of room for them compared to if you are planting to attract the bees where you can put them closer together. </span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We offer many different ProCut varieties in several colors, including </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/procut-lemon-sunflower/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProCut Lemon Sunflower\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lemon</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProCut Orange Sunflower\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Orange</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/procut-plum-sunflower/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProCut Plum Sunflower\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plum</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/procut-red-sunflower/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProCut Red Sunflower\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Red</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/procut-white-nite-sunflower/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProCut White Nite Sunflower\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">White Nite</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, and</span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/procut-red-lemon-bicolor-sunflower/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProCut Red Lemon Bicolor Sunflower\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Red Lemon Bicolor.</span></a></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How-To Cut the Perfect Flower</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A bouquet can range anywhere from $20-$100 dollars, or you can go out to the garden and make your own!

    "title": "Warm-Season Cover Crops will be the Best Thing to Happen to your Soil",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:47:00-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What is the Best Warm-Season Cover Crop?</h2>\nCover crops are a great way to improve the health and nutrients of your soil. Warm-season cover crops work explicitly great as a transition between spring and fall gardens. In South Georgia, that means we can plant warm-season cover crops anywhere from early spring until late fall. So how do you know which one to use? All cover crops offer a variety of benefits, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing atmospheric nitrogen and adding it to soils</li>\n<li>Building soils by adding organic matter known as “green manure.”</li>\n<li>Controlling erosion by reducing water runoff and nutrient leaching</li>\n<li>Suppressing weed growth by providing a dense foliage canopy</li>\n<li>Managing pests by reducing harmful nematodes and soil fungi</li>\n</ul>\nMany gardeners use several different cover crops to make a \"cocktail\" specific for their needs. They make their decision based on soil needs and what was planted in the plot before. For example, if you planted something in the Nightshade family such as peppers, eggplant, potatoes, and tomatoes, you wouldn't want to follow that up with another type of nightshade in that same plot until after you do a cover crop. If you don't break up the planting with a cover crop, you could rob your soil of all its nutrients, making it unplantable. The following seeds are the warm-season cover crops Hoss Tools offers:\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Iron Clay Pea\" href=\"/products/iron-clay-pea/\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Clay Pea</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Brown Top Millet\" href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\">Brown Top Millet</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Buckwheat\" href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\">Buckwheat</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Sunn Hemp\" href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunn Hemp</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>All About Buckwheat</h2>\n<p>Cover crops are unique to each soil type and zone area, so it is hard to say which one is the best. For our soil here in zone 8b, where we had previously planted summer squash, we decided that Buckwheat would help it the best. Buckwheat is mainly good at weed suppression because of its fast growth and ability to outspread thee weeds. In one specific plot, we were dealing with pigweeds and crabgrass, which helped us make our decision of using Buckwheat. The Buckwheat will spread out over the weeds, not allowing any sun to reach them, which eventually kills off the weeds. Another advantage of Buckwheat is the organic matter it provides to the soil. Adding organic matter to your soil loosens the topsoil, which increases drainage capabilities. Making sure your soil can accurately take in water is a critical ingredient in having a fruitful garden. Even if you have the perfect soil and seed, if you have no pollinators, you can still end up with no vegetables or fruits. For our average gardener, they cannot bring in a hive of bees, but they can do things to draw in those pollinators organically. Buckwheat can help with that too!! Four to six weeks after planting, Buckwheat will put off a small flower attracting pollinators to the garden. When planting Buckwheat you can go in with a seeder to plant it or broadcast plant it in the plot. Broadcast seeding is scattering the seed, by hand or mechanically, over an area. If you decide to broadcast seed it, you will need to go in and rake it very well, so the seeds are about 1/2 inch deep. The rate of Buckwheat is three pounds for every 1,000 square feet. So with a 500-foot plot, you will only need one and a half pounds. After two to three weeks, the flowers and Buckwheat will be ready to mow down and be incorporated in the soil so that your next crop can quickly reap its benefits. It would be best if you did all of this on time. Check out our cover crop page on the Hoss Tools website to answer more of your questions!

    "body_html": "<h2>How-To Scratch Potatoes</h2>\n<p>Scratching is a southern term used in gardening, meaning digging up a few of your potatoes early. This blog is going to explain how-to scratch potatoes and help you enjoy your garden before that ten weeks maturity period is up. Potatoes have a long maturity period, and at times we can get a little impatient, and that's what leads us to scratch our potatoes. You want to make sure not to scratch too early, or the potatoes you dig up will be duds. We all want to enjoy our garden grown groceries, but sometimes it is just too hard to wait!! If it is almost harvest time, though, and you are craving some of those homemade mashed potatoes, then this should do the trick. If your potatoes are dry, wherever you see a crack, you want to follow it down, easing your fingers until you feel a potato. Then you are going to ease it up, out of the ground. You want to make sure you are careful not to damage the plant and that you feel around to grab one of the bigger potatoes. If you scratch the right way, your potato plant will never even know! </p>\n<h2>Walk Around the Garden</h2>\n<p>As our spring garden is starting to be in full bloom, we take a walk around to see what is producing the best this year—highlighting some of our best varieties around our spring garden.  The first thing that we notice is the <a href=\"/products/rattlesnake-pole-bean/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Rattlesnake Pole Beans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rattlesnake Pole Beans</a>, growing to be one of the tallest in our garden and also one of the prettiest because of their pretty purple bloom. These Rattlesnake Pole Beans are an heirloom variety and can grow to be around ten feet tall. Though we often say our hybrid varieties produce more crop, that isn't necessarily the case with this bean. The Rattlesnake Pole bean gets harvested very often, producing pods that are six to seven inches long. This bean does well in our climate because of our hot and humid temperatures.  <a href=\"/products/blue-bayou-pumpkin/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Blue Bayou Winter Squash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blue Bayou Winter Squash</a> is something new in the garden that we were very excited to grow. This pumpkin is a hybrid variety with an heirloom look that also offers downy and powdery mildew resistance. Though it grows like our summer squash varieties, it is a winter squash that has about a 90-day maturity rate. After 90 days, the crop should be around 15-20 pounds. Only standing about six inches tall, our <a href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jambalaya Okra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jambalaya Okra</a> is starting to bloom and already becoming very productive; it won't be much longer until they are ready to harvest. The Jambalaya Okra plant will produce heavy yields of green pods that are great for pickling, frying, and stewing.  Now, in an area that we didn't have many plans for, we decided to use an attractive option for a cover crop, The ProCut Plum Sunflower. This flower is a single stalk sunflower that is pollen-less yet still gives off a massive bloom. The ProCut sunflower is incredible for drawing in your pollinators to help your other plants with production. The last thing in our garden is one of Greg's favorite crops, watermelon. He decided to grow an old heirloom variety called Moon and Stars that his granddaddy grew to see how it compares to the new hybrids. Greg noticed something weird with the foliage once they started to come up out of the ground; it had yellow spots on it. He hasn't quite figured out the spacing on what works best, but their yellow flower bloom is starting to come up nicely.  Click on the Video Below to see this garden in action or to learn more on Gardening with Greg!! </p>\n<div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmJlHh6DQCc\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tips to Help the Beginner Gardener</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Summer squash is the first thing to pop up in your spring garden with an only 55-60 day maturity rate; these few tips will help take your summer squash to the next level. With all plants, you have to find the seed that is right for you, at Hoss Tools we enjoy using the hybrid varieties as they boost in production. Hybrid means that the seeds get cross-pollinated, not that they are a GMO. You also have to decide if you want to plant a crookneck or straight neck squash.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are always choices in gardening, and when you get ready to plant, you are faced with the decision to direct seed or to transplant. Transplanting can be very beneficial with many crops, but with squash, we have seen that direct seeding does better as they germinate quickly. When you are direct seeding, you want to make sure you plant every twelve inches apart to ensure adequate spacing. Squash spreads out across the plot, so you want to make sure they are not all over each other.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To be able to take care of your squash, you need to understand the importance of pollination. Summer Squash has two blooms, the higher one is the male bloom, and the lower one with the flower is the female bloom. The bee first goes to the male bloom and then to the female to pollinate. If you do not have pollinators present in your garden, you will either have no fruit or a very misshaped squash. Once the flower falls off, that usually is a tell-tell sign that your squash is ready to be picked.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Squash is a plant that has to be harvested every two to three days once they start to pop up. We suggest that you pick them on the smaller size as that is when they are nice and tender. If you let the fruits grow to large, that leaves them open to more disease and pests and can make them unpalatable.

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is a Cover Crop?</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the most basic definition, a cover crop is a plant that covers the soil while you are not using it. Growing a cover crop is going to lead to healthier soil and a more productive garden. Because of its many benefits, some farmers/gardeners like to mix two cover crops in a field and call it a cover crop cocktail. Whether you are using just one crop or a cocktail, it is crucial for your soil and the future of your crops.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many cover crops, with each one having different benefits for your soil, for example, </span><a href=\"/products/hairy-vetch/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hairy Vetch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hairy Vetch</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Hairy Vetch is a cool-season crop as well as a legume, meaning that it stores up nitrogen and phosphorous in its roots, so it helps make the soil rich for your next crop. Another example is </span><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/winter-rye/\" class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Winter Rye\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rye</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which is also a cool-season crop, and it is a cereal grain. Rye works well in soils where erosion and weeds are a problem because it helps fight both of those. These two cover crops, Rye and Hairy Vetch work well together because they differ in what they do. Planting these two as a cocktail will help keep your soil flat with no weeds and continue to stay rich in minerals underneath.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In South Georgia, specifically, we push our soil almost all times of the year, we can do this because of our weather conditions. We have to keep up with our crop rotation and understand the importance of taking care of our soil. That is why it is so imperative to plan out what you will be planting and where each crop will be at so you can know what cover crops will benefit your land the most. Planning is essential in every stage of gardening to get the most out of your crops.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cool Season Types of Cover Crops</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/products/broadleaf-mustard/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Broadleaf Mustard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Broadleaf Mustard</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/austrian-winter-pea/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Austrian Winter Pea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Austrian Winter Pea</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/crimson-clover/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Crimson Clover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crimson Clover</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tillage Radish\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tillage Radish</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Warm Season Types of Cover Crops</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Brown Top Millet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brown Top Millet</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Buckwheat\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Buckwheat</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sunn Hemp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunn Hemp</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sorghum Sudangrass</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What do I do Now?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once you have figured out what cover crop seed will work best for your soil, and you know where and what will be going in the garden after the cover crop, then you go in there and direct seed them into the same plot. If you decide to do the cocktail of two crops, you can plant the two seeds at the same time and then rake them in together. This mixing will help spread the benefits of both crops across the plot.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Next, you are going to leave your cover crops growing until right before they start to seed. You will know they are beginning to germinate once you see it forming. When they are about to drop the seed, that means it is time to work that cover crop back in. If you have a flail mower, you can cut it down, and it will incorporate the crops back in but no worries if you do not you can do it with a regular lawnmower as well.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before it is time for you to plant your garden, you are going to cut it down and till it all in together as you plant your garden and watch it grow to pay attention to how your garden benefited before and after using a cover crop. Hopefully, your garden will be the most fruitful it has ever been.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Check out our cover crops seed page to see a break down of all the crops, if you are still on the fence about planting them check out the video below!</span></p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcBAsy05T30\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:54-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Best Way to Irrigate the Garden</h2>\nThe most effective way to maximize garden production is by using drip tape irrigation that will be applied to plant roots and you can use <a title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">water-soluble fertilizers</a> directly through the drip to supply plants better with needed nutrients. Most people believe that drip tape can be used either on top or buried in the soil. However, drip tape was really made to go underneath the soil in the garden. This allows the irrigation tape to stay in place, decrease disease pressure, and reduce damage caused by natural causes. It also provides plenty of needed nutrients for plant growth and healthier plants in the vegetable garden. Not only does it apply equal amounts of irrigation to the plants, but it conserves water by going directly to the plant roots in the vegetable garden, unlike overhead irrigation systems.\n<h2>Simplest Way to Install Drip Tape</h2>\n<p>The first component to setting up the drip tape irrigation in the garden is to layout the <a title=\"Mainline Tubing\" href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\" target=\"_blank\">mainline tubing</a> which will help distribute water to each drip line effectively along the desired rows. Then, to feed the mainline tubing we use a <a title=\"Filter Regulator Combo\" href=\"/products/filter-regulator-combo/\" target=\"_blank\">filter regulator combo</a> which has a filter to trap any particulate material from entering the tape and the pressure regulator that reduces the pressure of water entering the low-pressure drip tape system. We recommend placing this filter regulator in the middle of the drip tape irrigation to ensure you get equal amounts of water distributed along each row in the garden. The next step is to bury the drip tape for a couple of different reasons. The first reason is during the hotter months your surface evaporation is going to greatly reduce meaning your plants will be able to use more of the water that is being put out if you have buried drip irrigation. Another reason to bury the tape is to simply just get it out of the way so you don't have to move it around every time you cultivate the soil. When it comes burying drip tape the best tool to use is our <a title=\"Drip Tape Layer Attachment\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\">Drip Tape Layer</a> attachment. When hooking up the row starts and row ends this will complete the setup of the drip system. The <a title=\"Drip Tape Row Start\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-start/\" target=\"_blank\">row start</a> is designed to connect the drip tape along the rows to the mainline tubing and the <a title=\"Drip Tape Row End\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-end/\" target=\"_blank\">row ends</a> are the easiest way to seal the end of the tape. Overall, we recommend using drip tape to ensure you supply your plants with the needed nutrients and irrigation directly to the roots throughout the growing season.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SGkY2FYbdaI?si=lbgI8GvPtJWDDtRQ\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"></div>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:53-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Fall Transplants</h2>\n<p>In the 30 by 35 garden plot, Travis has 11 rows that are ready for fall transplants. To prepare the garden for fall planting, he had to first clean the area from any previous crops. The next step is to add in some chicken manure and till it in to help improve the structure or tilth of the soil. Instead of adding in a new drip tape manifold, Travis saved the previous setup to use again for fall transplants. Then, he added in furrows by using the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the plow set attachment in the furrowing position in order to push soil outward and create a nice little furrow for the drip tape to be laid in. Once the vegetable garden is set up perfectly for fall planting it's now time to plant the transplants from the greenhouse. The first two crops that he is going to plant several rows of are the Tiger Collards and <a href=\"/products/lacinato-kale/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lacinto Kale\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lacinato Kale</a> which are very productive producers in the vegetable garden. Then, in the remainder of the plot, he is going to plant some <a href=\"/products/green-magic-broccoli/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Green Magic Broccoli\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Green Magic Broccoli</a> which is a nice heat-tolerant variety as well as, some <a href=\"/products/snow-bowl-cauliflower/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Snow Bowl Cauliflower\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snow Bowl Cauliflower</a> which is another excellent crop to plant in the fall. The best way to plant the transplants in the garden is by walking along the rows and drop a plant by every water spot from the drip tape. Then, once the majority of the rows have plants Travis will get on his knees and scoot along the rows to plant the transplants in the garden soil.</p>\n<h2>Transplanting vs. Direct Seeding</h2>\n<p>When it comes to transplanting or direct-seeding it is simply up to the gardener which method they prefer in their vegetable garden. However, there are benefits to both methods, and some crops do better transplanted while others do better direct-seeded. Transplants offer bountiful benefits when it comes to growing vegetables in the garden. Not only do you get to control when you plant seedlings but you also get better germination rates which will produce healthier growing plants. Another example, for transplanting instead of direct seeding is if you have warmer weather vegetables that you would like to get a headstart on growing this allows you to prepare those vegetables before the growing season starts. Therefore, when the growing season begins and weather conditions are ideal you already have germinated plants that are ready to go in the soil in the fall garden. Transplanting also reduces weed pressures due to them having limited time in the garden area. Since the transplants are already germinated they provide a stronger immune to weeds that will have a little amount of time to germinate in the garden. Another benefit is improved and faster crop turnaround. By starting the vegetables in transplants it can speed up the amount of time it takes them to germinate meaning less time in the garden area. With less time in the garden, more production is harvested and it allows for another crop to be planted in the same spot. Overall, transplanting allows for healthier and more productive vegetables while saving us time, money, and energy in the garden.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lM3IabKtdRc\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Quality Manure</h2>\n<p>There are several benefits to adding quality grade manure to create bountiful vegetable garden soils. Some of these benefits include increasing the productivity of crops, improved growth, and overall healthier plants in the area. By adding the best soil amendment it will leave your soil structure with increased benefits that are ideal for future growing seasons. Using great compost contains four key components — organic matter, moisture, bacteria, and oxygen. The organic matter provides the needed nitrogen and carbon sources for plant growth. While the moisture allows the compost to not dry out and the oxygen supports the breakdown of plant material. Then, the other microorganisms like bacteria will break down all the components and plant material into the useful compost material needed for the vegetable garden. When incorporating the compost in sandy soils it can increase the water-holding capacity, while in the heavier clay soils it can improve drainage. Another advantage of adding compost to the soil is the decrease in using lots of fertilizer in the area.</p>\n<h2>Bountiful Vegetable Garden</h2>\n<p>One of the most important factors to growing a bountiful vegetable garden is adding a quality grade chicken manure compost. Travis picked up some excellent manure compost that is relatively dry and broken down which will spread in the garden effectively and till into the soil well. This compost is ideal for the fall garden when getting ready to plant some heavy feeder crops like cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. As mentioned early we won't have to add as much liquid or granular fertilizer because the compost will feed the soil pretty well. Travis has already prepared the first 2 plots that he is going to plant in for the fall garden. After broadcasting the compost on the two plots it's now time to till in the garden in order to incorporate it into the soil. Most of the time we do the fad system in the garden which means furrow, amend, and <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drip</a>. Instead of using the fad system and applying compost only in the furrow where plants are going to be planted we make an exception and broadcast the compost throughout the vegetable garden. Since this is a new garden area it will need a little more help when it comes to amending and conditioning the entire plot to make the soil more workable and increase nutrients throughout the plot. Another factor to remember is that fall crops will be planted close together so you might as well compost the entire area because it really won't affect the vegetables negatively if you broadcast it throughout the vegetable garden plot.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgbBdGp2R3Y\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

When losing plants in the garden it doesn't mean you should give up or quit taking chances when growing plants. Gardening is a variable thing because we have no control over weather temperatures or conditions that may happen throughout the growing season. Sometimes we plant as soon as we think we can plant a certain crop and it can work out wonderful or fail other times in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Why Are We Losing Plants?</h2>\n<p>In the past, we have planted <a href=\"/products/kentucky-blue-pole-bean/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kentucky Blue Pole Beans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kentucky Blue Pole Beans</a> around early September to late August to get a headstart on germination before the cool weather comes through. However, this season the weather has not cooperated like normal, and it has turned out hotter than usual. With hotter temperatures, we have experienced a decline in production while also losing plants in the vegetable garden. Our pole beans started off with really good germination, and everything was growing fine until the hot temperatures began to stay around longer than expected. Although a few of the plants thrived a bunch of them look pitiful and have experienced disease pressure problems.</p>\n<h2>Winning in the Vegetable Garden</h2>\n<p>Although we may be losing plants we are also winning with a few plants in the garden. On the same day of planting pole beans, we also planted a row of <a href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Stonewall Cucumbers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stonewall Cucumbers</a>. We have gave both crops the same amount of treatment but the cucumbers seem to be thriving better than the pole beans. This variety of cucumbers is gynoecious which means they produce predominantly female flowers. These cucumbers have a few white specks on the leaves that indicate insect issues that will need to be dealt with which whitefly eggs. To help control these insect pressures we will start a spray program using <a href=\"/products/horticultural-oil/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Horticultural Oil\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Horticultural Oil</a> for whiteflies and <a href=\"/products/monterey-bt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Monterey Bt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monterey BT</a>. to take care of pickle worms.

    "title": "Using the High Arch Wheel Hoe on Fall Sweet Corn",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:51-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Fall Sweet Corn</h2>\n<p>When it comes to planting fall sweet corn or any kind of corn variety it should be planted in blocks or squares for better pollination. Planting in blocks instead of long rows ensures that once the crop starts tasselling the wind can effectively pollinate the corn. Corn is a self-pollinating plant that produces a male flower, which is commonly referred to as a tassel, and a female flower, which is commonly referred to as the silks. In order for kernels of corn to be produced by the plant, the male flowers must pollinate the female flowers. The male flower is located at the very top of the plant whereas the female flower is formed along the stalk of the plant. The male flower contains the pollen, which is primarily spread by wind, that will be used to pollinate the female plant in the garden. Another major factor of planting sweet corn is it needs plenty of <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drip irrigation</a> to grow throughout the growing season. Since corn is a heavy feeder it needs plenty of water and fertilizer to get healthy producing plants in the vegetable garden. We suggest using <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">20-20-20</a> around four times throughout the growing season. The garden previously had a <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Silage Tarp 40x50\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">silage tarp</a> over the area to help improve the garden soils before planting fall sweet corn. Once the tarp was removed we used the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wheel Hoe Walk Behind Plow Set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plow set attachment</a> to create furrows where our desired rows would be and a place to bury the drip tape.</p>\n<h2>Hilling and Side Dressing</h2>\n<p>In the garden, we have seven rows of <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Peaches and Cream Sweet Corn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peaches and Cream Sweet Corn</a> that is around a foot or a little over in height and is ready to be hilled. The hilling process basically means we will throw soil on top of the bottom structure of plants in order to provide a strong base stalk, kill off germinating weeds, and help retain soil moisture. However, before we hill sweet corn we need to side-dress alongside the stalks. By side-dressing, we are able to add a good quality granular fertilizer which helps add a slow-release action to the corn plants. We recommend using a side-dress fertilizer such as <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chilean Nitrate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chilean Nitrate</a> and the general rule of thumb is to put around ten pounds per thousand square feet of corn. When side-dressing the fertilizer you need to place it close enough to the plants for the plow set to cover and bury it but not so close that it burns the plant. When going to hill the corn plants we suggest using the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"High Arch Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> which allows us to go along the row of plants and easily hill in one pass through. Another advantage of using the high arch is you can adjust the distance between the wheels to either narrow or wider hilling position. Overall, hilling and side dressing fall sweet corn allow us to make our garden rows more manageable and increase our production in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHTjWBdIh50\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Cover Cropping Garden Soils</h2>\n<p>The main benefit of cover cropping the garden is the many beneficial nutrients that they can incorporate into the soils. Not only can they improve your garden soils but they can also control weeds, increase yields, and reduce soil erosion. Cover cropping soil also allows you to plant year-round keeping your garden manageable and workable for future growing seasons. When picking the right cover crop for your area keep in mind what your soil needs to improve on for the next growing season. As with all cover crops, remember they should be cut or mowed down before going to seed in order to prevent reseeding issues in the future.</p>\n<h2>Planting Sorghum Sudangrass</h2>\n<p>When planting a warm-season cover crop such as <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a> this is a fast producing crop that quickly outpaces the growth of competing weeds. Some of the benefits that sudangrass adds into the soil is outstanding \"green manure\" that adds a significant amount of organic matter to increase soil health and tilth once incorporated into the garden soil. Also, with the addition of organic matter through cover cropping, we are able to suppress nematode populations. The ideal time to plant sudangrass is once soils reach around 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit and can be broadcasted or planted with a planter like our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. Although it can be planted in the Spring we recommend using it as a transition crop between Spring and Fall crops to get the best results. Currently, in the garden, we had a nice thick stand of sudangrass vegetation that we laid or crimped in the area. Once the area was crimped then we laid a <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Silage Tarp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">silage tarp</a> over top to help kill off all the vegetation. After a couple of weeks of the tarp being on the area, it is now time to remove it to see how the soil is doing in the garden spot. The tarp did an excellent job of killing off all the vegetation and we are able to see just how great the cover crop was broken down throughout the area. Now, it's time to add some good quality compost that we can broadcast all throughout the soil and then either re-tarp it or till it until we are ready to plant in the area again.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/30c45b7V5-A\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

In the first <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seed Starting Trays\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seed starting tray</a>, we have the Savannah Sweet onion variety that has a few seed germinating but not a full tray. In the next tray, there are four lettuce varieties such as <a href=\"/products/cherokee-lettuce/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cherokee Lettuce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cherokee</a>, <a href=\"/products/butter-crunch-lettuce/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Butter Crunch Lettuce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Butter Crunch</a>, <a href=\"/products/skyphos-butterhead-lettuce/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Skyphos Butterhead Lettuce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skyphos</a>, and <a href=\"/products/calshot-romaine-lettuce/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Calshot Romaine Lettuce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calshot</a> that have just been added to the greenhouse so no germination quite yet on those. In the third tray, we have <a href=\"/products/calendula-prince-mix/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Calendula Prince Mix\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calendula</a> which is a cool flower that produces colorful blend of yellow and orange blooms. The two varieties of beets that are growing are <a href=\"/products/kestrel-beet/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kestrel Beet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kestral</a> and <a href=\"/products/early-wonder-beet/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Early Wonder Beet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Early Wonder</a> which are both excellent beet varieties. The fifth seed starting tray has some <a href=\"/products/matejko-leek/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matejko Leek\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matejko</a> leeks which is a hybrid variety of leek that has really good germination right now in the greenhouse. Then in the last few trays, we have some <a href=\"/products/cheers-cabbage/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cheers Cabbage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cheers Cabbage</a>, <a href=\"/products/charleston-wakefield-cabbage/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Charleston Wakefield Cabbage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Charleston Wakefield</a>, and <a href=\"/products/rio-grande-red-cabbage/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Rio Grande Cabbage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rio Grande Cabbage</a>. Along the other side of the greenhouse, there is a tray of <a href=\"/products/southern-giant-curled-mustard/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Southern Giant Curled Mustard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Southern Giant Curled Mustard</a> which can be direct seeded into the garden, but Travis decided to try transplanting for this growing season. The next tray is some <a href=\"/products/scarlet-kale/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Scarlet Kale\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scarlet Kale</a> which is an open-pollinated variety that produces deep red plants. Beside the kale flat, is some nice germinated <a href=\"/products/touchstone-gold-beet/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Touchstone Gold Beets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Touchstone Gold Beets</a> which are multigerm so each seed will give you two to three little sprouts. Then, two flats of <a href=\"/products/green-magic-broccoli/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Green Magic Broccoli\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Green Magic Broccoli</a> and two different varieties of cauliflower which are <a href=\"/products/snow-bowl-cauliflower/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Snow Bowl Cauliflower\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snow Bowl</a> and Purple Cauliflower. Next, in the greenhouse is a flat of <a href=\"/products/jade-cross-brussels-sprouts/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jade Cross Brussel Sprouts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jade Cross Brussel Sprouts</a> and a flat of <a href=\"/products/red-bull-brussels-sprouts/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Red Bull Brussels Sprouts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Bull</a>. While in the last two flats that are currently growing is the famous Tiger Collards that is one of the most productive crops you can grow in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Three Factors to Why Seeds Are Not Germinating</h2>\n<p>Within the greenhouse, there are three factors that can help determine why your garden seeds may not be growing. The first factor that is important for germination is moisture. The seed starting mix that we use is <a href=\"/products/pro-mix-organic-seed-starting-mix/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProMix Organic Seed Starting Mix\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pro-Mix</a> which is a quality grade mix that promotes excellent root development. For water to drain really well through the tray, you must soak the soil to ensure you are watering throughout the entire seed starting tray. The second factor that is important is heat during the fall this really isn't an issue because of our weather temperatures in the South. However, during the spring, we have to use a heat map that will give the soil the desired optimal germination temperature. Typically the garden soil needs to be around 75 degrees to germinate well. While the third biggest factor in why you may experience bad germination is poor quality seeds. If you buy cheap seeds more than likely, you will receive poor germination. However, here at Hoss, we believe in excellent germination rates and high-quality garden seeds. We test our seeds every six to nine months to ensure you are getting fresh seeds with excellent germination rates when you order from us.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOd0iYykAxI\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:50-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Factors of Planting Sweet Corn</h2>\n<p>The three most important factors when growing the best sweet corn are pollination, irrigation, and fertilization. When it comes to planting our Peaches and Cream sweet corn it should be planted in blocks or squares because corn is pollinated by the wind, therefore planting in blocks instead of long rows ensures that once the crop starts tasselling the wind can effectively pollinate the sweet corn. Since corn is a self-pollinating plant that produces a male flower, which is commonly referred to as a tassel, and a female flower, which is commonly referred to as the silks. In order for kernels of corn to be produced by the plant, the male flowers must pollinate the female flowers. The male flower is located at the very top of the plant whereas the female flower is formed along the stalk of the plant. The male flower contains the pollen, which is primarily spread by the wind and that will be used to pollinate the female plant located on the stalk of the plant. Another major factor of growing sweet corn is it needs plenty of irrigation to grow in the garden. We recommend using drip tape because it ensures all the water is going directly to the plant roots where they need it the most in the vegetable garden. Also, corn is a heavy feeder that needs plenty of fertilizer to grow healthy producing plants. Before planting the corn, we recommend at pre-plant to add a good amount of compost down in the garden soil. Then, once the corn gets around knee-high, you can start fertilizing using a fertilizer injector through the drip system. We recommend injecting <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">20-20-20</a> fertilizer and <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chilean Nitrate Fertilizer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chilean Nitrate</a> which both add the needed nutrients for healthy and productive sweet corn plants.</p>\n<h2>Growing Peaches and Cream</h2>\n<p>As we prepare to plant our fall corn variety, <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Peaches and Cream Sweet Corn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peaches and Cream Sweet Corn</a> is our go-to variety this growing season. This variety is a se or sugary extender type of sweet corn which means it matures a little quicker than some of the other standard varieties. Peaches and Cream is a bicolor that produces yellow and white kernels on the same cob and tends to have a little sweet flavor profile. Before we begin planting sweet corn we have to ensure our seed plates for the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">garden seeder</a> are calibrated correctly and runs freely through the seeder. To prepare the garden for planting we will incorporate the F.A.D system which means furrow, amend, and drip. Using the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a>, we are able to add a small furrow within the garden that provides a space to plant the sweet corn. Then, we will amend the soil within that furrow we created and add drip tape for better irrigation. By planting seven rows of sweet corn we are able to get as much production as possible in the garden area. The maturity date on the Peaches and Cream sweet corn is around 80 days, however, with warmer temperatures in the growing cycle, we will be able to harvest the corn around 65 to 70 days. There are several great sweet corn varieties that we have available, but we are excited to try the Peaches and Cream in the Fall vegetable garden this year.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYqbmTnc9LI\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "body_html": "<h2>What is No-Till?</h2>\n<p>The meaning behind no-till gardening is the process of turning over around 6 to 10 inches of soil that will loosen and remove any plant matter for planting new crops in the area. While tilling sounds ideal it can actually harm the soil by striping the rich organic matter and insects that form healthy soil biology. Therefore, by using the no-till technique we are able to leave the garden soil intact and improve the soil using better practices such as cover crops and <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-30-x-40/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Silage Tarp 30x40\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">silage tarping</a> the area.</p>\n<h2>Growing Corn in the Garden</h2>\n<p>Currently, in the garden, we have a silage tarp that has been on our future fall corn plot for about six weeks and is ready to be removed for planting. Once the tarp is removed we are able to see the nice soil that is ready to be worked and prepared for fall planting. To begin preparing the garden for growing corn we need to start with the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and <a href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wheel Hoes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plow set</a> attachment to help us make furrows for laying drip tape in the garden. We recommend using the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drip Tape Layer Attachment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drip tape layer</a> attachment to easily bury and effectively lay drip tape in straight rows. Now that we have seven rows ready to plant fall corn we will start with the <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Peaches and Cream Sweet Corn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peaches and Cream</a> variety. This sweet corn variety is a hybrid bicolor that is known for being a sugary extender which means it can store longer than standard varieties once harvested. By using a cover crop and silage tarp to increase the nutrients the overall cultivation is minimal. Another factor of planting corn is the crop is wind-pollinated which means you always want to plant in a square plot for better pollination. Therefore, wind pollination allows the tassels to start forming on the tops of the male flowers where the pollen will begin to pollinate the female flowers on the ears or silks of the corn. Another major factor of growing corn is it needs plenty of irrigation to grow in the garden. We recommend using drip tape because it ensures all the water is going directly to the plant roots where they need it the most to grow in the vegetable garden. Also, since corn is a heavy feeder it needs plenty of fertilizer to grow healthy plants. Some fertilization products like <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">20-20-20</a> or <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chilean Nitrate Fertilizer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chilean Nitrate</a> are great for feeding the plants. While using <a href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Spinosad Garden Insect Spray\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spinosad Insect Spray</a> is great for controlling worm pressure which is important when corn starts tasseling in the garden. When growing the best sweet corn these three important factors such as pollination, irrigation, and fertilization can all ensure that you produce the most productive and healthiest sweet corn in the vegetable garden all throughout the growing season.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BANbkbfRxbU\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Preparing Healthy Garden Soils</h2>\n<p>There are many aspects that factor into getting healthy garden soils in your desired planting area. When starting out the best way to see what type of pH level you have in your soil is by testing to see what nutrients need to be added and what does not. Another factor in achieving healthy garden soils is by adding organic matter to help improve the structure or tilth of the soil in the ground. Also, by incorporating a good quality compost we can increase the water, air, and nutrients that the plants need in the vegetable garden. In addition, adding cover crops after you harvest a crop can help bring nutrients back into the soil before planting a new crop for the next growing season. By preparing the soils to best of our ability we are able to improve our nutrients, production, and overall ability to grow healthy plants.</p>\n<h2>Getting the Garden Ready for Fall Planting</h2>\n<p>Since planting pole beans and cucumbers for the fall garden they have started to come up and get really good germination. Now it's time to get some other plots ready for some cool weather crops in the next few weeks. We'll be starting transplants in the greenhouse, therefore the plots need to be ready once the transplants are ready to be planted. There are a couple of plots in the garden that have cover crops that need to be extinguished so we get those areas ready for fall planting. Currently, we have a dense crop of <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a> that is starting to go to seed so we need to take care of it before it goes any further in the garden. Travis is going to try something new like crimping the sudangrass which means he is going to lay it down using the riding lawnmower with the deck laid down as low as it will go in order to run over the cover crop and fold it over in the area. Once it is folded over or laid down he will take the <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-30-x-40/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Silage Tarp 30x40\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">silage tarp</a> to help kill all the vegetation in the garden plot. When the tarp is laid down the plan is to let the sorghum die down which should take around two weeks and then remove the tarp in order to add compost and lightly till it in the soil. During the tilling process, a few weed seeds will probably pop up so we will put the tarp back on the area for another couple of weeks to kill any of the weed seeds that are in the garden soil. Then, when you pull the tarp off for the second time around four to five weeks when it's time to transplant the healthy garden soils should be ideal for fall planting. Now in the <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Brown Top Millet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brown Top Millet</a> plot, the cover crop is going to seed and needs to be taken care of before it continues seeding. Travis is going to add the silage tarp on this plot but there is a different plan before tarping the area. Since this cover crop only got around knee-high we are able to just mow it down with the push mower that has a mulching deck that won't blow it around and will leave it right in the area. Once the millet is mowed down now it's time to tarp the area to allow the green manure to decompose nicely into the soil and ready for fall planting. When dealing with cover crops they don't require a lot of equipment to maintain and build up the soils. Therefore, cover crops are ideal for preparing garden soils with little to no hassle.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCm4GMP0dPU\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Preparing for Fall Planting</h2>\n<p>When getting ready for a busy fall planting it's important to prepare the garden soil to the best of your ability before the future growing season. By using good compost manure to replenish the vegetable garden soil with the needed nutrients for crops you are able to ensure the soil is ready for fall planting.</p>\n<h2>Currently in the Vegetable Garden</h2>\n<p>Travis currently has his garden broken into 10 subplots to help make a better rotation of crops and manage the gardens better. In the first subplot, he has a warm-season cover crop <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a> that provides excellent ground coverage throughout the garden. Instead of chopping it up and laying it on the soil, Travis is thinking about crimping it then using the <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Silage Tarp 40x50\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">silage tarp</a> to cover it up. On the second subplot, he has a nice stand of jambalaya okra but they are not producing okra pods because we might be giving them to much fertilizer. When growing okra you have to be careful not to give them to much fertilizer, otherwise, you will get all vegetation and not a lot of okra production. On the third plot, we have four rows of peppers and two rows of eggplant throughout the garden area. They are supported using the Florida weave technique and are producing well in the heat as we continue to give them plenty of irrigation and fertilizer them about every two weeks. The two different eggplant varieties that are growing are <a href=\"/products/purple-shine-eggplant/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Purple Shine Eggplant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purple Shine</a> and Striped Italian Eggplant. Then, as far as pepper growing we have a variety of hot and sweet varieties. Next, in plot number four we have tomatoes planted from the spring and took the advice from our viewers to use wheat straw mulch around the plants and till it into the soil to help add organic matter. Since planting tomatoes, Travis has come in the area and planted a cover crop of <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sunn Hemp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sunn Hemp</a> that has been growing fast and will help add nitrogen to restore the soils for fall planting in the area. In two more subplots of the vegetable garden, there are <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Brown Top Millet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Millet</a> and <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Buckwheat\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buckwheat</a> cover crops planted to help prepare the plots for fall planting. Then, in plot number seven this is the oldest plot we have in the dream garden and we have more okra growing that's around seven to eight-foot-tall. Instead of pulling the okra plants, Travis has decided to take his loppers and cut it clean to the soil so he can leave the root structure there and just cover crop on top of it. In a couple of other subplots in the vegetable garden is <a href=\"/products/lacinato-kale/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lacinato Kale\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lacinato Kale</a> that is ready to harvest and <a href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Stonewall Cucumbers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stonewall Cucumbers</a> that did really well but ready to be cleaned from the area as well. Also, some flowers that were used to bring in pollinators in the area will just be mowed down before planting another cover crop to help prepare for fall planting even more. In plot number nine, Travis has an entire plot of Georgia Jet potatoes that has created a great dense mat of vegetation that will help prevent a lot of weed growth and allow the potatoes to thrive in the area. In the last plot of the dream garden, there is a crop of Tiger Collards that are still producing and two more rows of transplanted jambalaya okra to hopefully make up for the other okra that is not producing. Once the Tiger Collards are done producing he hopes to plant pole beans and maybe a fall crop of cucumbers in the entire plot.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JLw_atiM-E\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Summer Planting</h2>\n<p>It is around the peak of warm temperatures for the summer growing season this year. With this kind of warm weather conditions, there's not a lot of vegetable crops that will produce in the garden area. However, some crops like okra, sweet potatoes, and zinnias can continue to grow in these temperatures. This is why we recommend building up your soils during the summer to prepare them for planting in the fall. Using a summer cover crop is not only great for shorter growing windows but you also maintain the garden and improve the soil tilth in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Summer Cover Crop</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is planting a beneficial summer cover crop to help build up the garden soils. He currently has two subplots in the dream garden that he is going to plant Buckwheat and Brown Top Millet. Before planting the summer cover crop, Travis used the tiller to help get the soil nice and fluffy to ensure the area gets good seed to soil and better germination in the vegetable garden. The <a title=\"Buckwheat\" href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\">Buckwheat</a> is perfect for smaller growing windows because it grows very fast compared to other cover crop varieties. It also breaks down quickly in the garden which will allow for faster turnover and replanting of vegetables in the following growing season. Buckwheat is ideal for maintaining weed suppression since it grows so fast it is able to outpace the growth of weeds, therefore, making it easier to control. Another benefit of this cover crop is it provides a significant amount of organic matter that will loosen and improve the topsoil this ensures the garden soil will be more workable and increase soil drainage in the area. The <a title=\"Brown Top Millet\" href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\">Brown Top Millet</a> is an excellent cover crop for livestock forage and green manure for adding organic matter to the soils. Typically millet is a tall, bunching grass that can reach up to 12 feet high which adds a \"mat\" over the soil that provides complete ground cover in the vegetable garden. The millet cover crop is also ideal for soils that have low moisture and low fertility with areas in high temperatures. Some of the benefits of planting millet is it can add significant amounts of organic matter to depleted soils which can improve soil tilth and quality. Travis recommends planting these two cover crop varieties with a precision planter like the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. With our seed plate design, you are able to customize the plates according to what seed varieties you are planting in the vegetable garden. Like all cover crops, they should be mowed or cut in order to incorporate back into the soil before going to seed. By incorporating them back into soils you will ensure that all nutrients is getting added into the garden soil and preventing weed issues in the future.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOiwJq9ZjAo?si=KrnS3uNzD0W4AIEE\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "title": "Fertilized vs. Unfertilized Plants in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:35-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Difference Between Fertilized vs. Unfertilized Plants</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is showing the difference between fertilized vs. unfertilized plants in the vegetable garden. When discussing whether you should fertilize plants or not, it has been experimentally proven that we need to fertilize plants in order to successfully grow crops. Fertilization plays a major role that can alter a lot of factors when planting and growing vegetables in the garden area.</p>\n<h2>Comparing Fertilization Plants</h2>\n<p>Travis some evidence on why fertilizing plants in the garden is needed to have a successful growing season. He currently has around a 40-foot row of <a title=\"Stonewall Cucumber\" href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\">Stonewall Cucumber</a> plants that has been able to continue production well into the late summer months. Not only is harvesting solid cucumbers but overall the plants are healthy with vegetation, leaves, and vegetables to show from the fertilization they have received. Across the garden on another plot, Travis has planted the same cucumbers that have experienced the same amount of irrigation but he left them as unfertilized plants. These unfertilized plants are having a harder time with production and not nearly as successful as the fertilized plants. When comparing the leaves between the two plants the fertilized plant has dark green leaves that are as big as a lily pad. While the unfertilized plant has yellowish leaves that seem to be experiencing a nutrient deficiency. With the fertilized cucumbers we are able to use our <a title=\"EZ-Flo Fertilizer Injector\" href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\" target=\"_blank\">EZ-Flo Injector</a> to not only supply enough irrigation but fertilizer as well directly to the plant roots. Travis recommends fertilizing the plants by mixing <a title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">20-20-20</a> and <a title=\"Micro Boost\" href=\"/products/micro-boost/\" target=\"_blank\">Micro Boost</a> into the injector. He suggests using about two pounds of the 20-20-20 and two cups of the micro boost to supply enough fertilizer to the cucumber plants. Whether you should fertilizer your plants or not all depends on your soil type conditions in the vegetable garden. Here in the South, we have sandy soils that are great for growing in because it's easy to work in and plant in. However, the downside of having sandy soils is it doesn't hold nutrients well which is very important for growing vegetables. If you have clay soils you don't have any problems with holding nutrients, therefore, it's not necessary for you to have frequent fertilization in the garden. Although for sandy soils we must fertilize our plants often to ensure we obtain enough nutrients to make healthy producing crops. Overall, to understand whether or not you should fertilizer, you should determine what soil type you have to help you grow the best vegetables you can in the garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5WanB5LkIU?si=UyZf4ttyle035s9s\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Cover Cropping with Sunn Hemp</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis and Greg have a patch of <a title=\"Sunn Hemp\" href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunn Hemp</a> which is a warm-season cover crop in the vegetable garden. This cover crop variety is a legume which means it is related to crops like beans, peas, peanuts, and hairy vetch. This is a beneficial cover crop that allows you to add a significant amount of nitrogen, suppress weeds, and quality organic matter back into the garden soils. However, compared to other warm-season varieties the Sunn Hemp is the only nitrogen fixer cover crop. As a nitrogen fixer, it is able to grab nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into your garden soil. This fixer is important in the garden because when you get rid of the cover crop you will gain lots of available nitrogen for the next vegetable crop you plant in that area. Some recent studies have shown that Sunn Hemp can fix up to 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre which is excellent when planting heavy feeder crops like onions and corn. Sunn Hemp should be planted when soil temperatures are around 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When planting it can be broadcasted or with a precision planter like the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">garden seeder</a>. It ultimately grows extremely fast and typically reaches maturity in 8 to 12 weeks. This cover crop variety is pretty much maintenance-free and does not take a lot of effort to grow in the area. Since it grows so quickly it suppresses weed pressures by outpacing weed germination which is a major benefit in the vegetable garden. Like all cover crops, Sunn Hemp should be cut or mowed before it reaches seed to prevent reseeding issues in the future growing seasons. The guys mention that the best time to cut or mow it into the soils is during the woody stage.</p>\n<h2>Benefit of Using Silage Tarps</h2>\n<p>However, Travis is going to try to extinguish this cover crop in the garden using silage tarps. Before adding the silage tarp to the area, Greg will take his flair mower to mow down the cover crop. Once the Sunn Hemp is laid flat it is ready to add the new silage tarp on top. Depending on the size of your garden, we offer a <a title=\"Silage Tarp 30x40\" href=\"/products/silage-tarp-30-x-40/\" target=\"_blank\">30' x 40'</a> and a <a title=\"Silage Tarp 40x50\" href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\" target=\"_blank\">40' x 50'</a> Silage Tarp. Using silage tarps as a garden technique is called occultation which essentially means that the tarp is blocking the sun from touching the soil. Therefore, the lack of sunlight penetrating the soil creates a warm, dark, moist environment in the vegetable garden. This environment facilitates the germination of weed seeds that quickly die due to the lack of sunlight. It also creates a dynamic soil life with abundant earthworm and beneficial bacterial populations. Another benefit of using silage tarps is when creating a new vegetable garden spot. The tarp can be used to kill existing grass and create a virtually weed-free garden area.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRFfOQ22G9Y?si=wbtT6SvfC3L_RKpI\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

Currently growing is a nice patch of <a title=\"Sunn Hemp\" href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunn Hemp</a> which is a warm-season cover crop that will provide a significant amount of biomass back into the soil. Since this cover crop is in the legume family it has the ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and transfer it in garden soils. Once it starts blooming, he will cut it down and place a silage tarp on top to help incorporate the nutrients back in the soil. Travis is going to plant another cover crop in the garden which is going to be <a title=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>. This is a great addition to soils that have been heavily farmed or that have been depleted of nutrients and organic matter. Before adding the cover crop into the area, he first uses a tiller to make the soil more workable for planting. Since the seeds are uniform and round it makes easier to plant using the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. The seeder ensures accurate planting along rows without wasting seed by overplanting in the vegetable garden. Travis mentions that the recommended rate for sudangrass is one pound per thousand square feet. He is planting the warm season cover crop in an area that is 30 x 35 which is around the recommended rate. Travis is going to broadcast the seeds a little bit thicker in the area to ensure he gets a complete ground cover in the garden spot. Once the seeds are broadcasted he will take a <a title=\"Dura Rake Landscape Rake\" href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\" target=\"_blank\">landscape rake</a> and just drag it along the soil to ensure the seeds are nice and covered up in the area. Finally, he will add an overhead sprinkler to the area to get some water to the seeds and allow them to start growing in the vegetable garden soils.</p>\n<h2>Beneficial Cover Crop Varieties</h2>\n<p>Two other beneficial warmers season cover crops are Buckwheat and Brown Top Millet. The <a title=\"Buckwheat\" href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\">Buckwheat</a> variety is known for being fast-growing which allows for quick turnover in the vegetable garden. It can be squeezed in smaller windows such as spring and fall plantings when you want to break off pest and disease cycles to improve future plantings. When it comes to the <a title=\"Brown Top Millet\" href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\">Brown Top Millet</a> it can provide excellent ground cover that will work well for weed suppression in the vegetable garden soils. Another benefit of the millet is it can be used as livestock forage and green manure for adding organic matter which will improve soil tilth and quality back into the garden area.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/izdZIHMOUlo?si=wrUcbFE93VYdic_M\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:28-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Trellising Vegetables</h2>\n<p>When it comes to trellising cucumbers, pole beans, or other vegetables there are several important reasons for doing this in the garden area. The first important reason for trellising plants is the ability to maximize space in smaller areas. For example, by trellising crops like pole beans you are able to plant on narrower rows that maximize production and productivity. The second reason behind trellising vegetables is the ability to add more stability to the growing plants. By adding additional stability to plants that are continuing to grow taller you are able to support the plants better and also increase productivity. Another important reason is the ability to monitor and control pests from trellised vegetables. When keeping plants off the ground and planted vertically we are able to control or reduce the amount of soil-borne diseases and other pests from taking over the vegetable garden. Overall, trellising vegetables can make harvesting much eaiser.</p>\n<h2>New Trellis Netting</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is explaining the ideal way for trellising cucumbers, pole beans, and more vegetables. Previously in the garden, he has used 16 foot long galvanized cattle panels to trellis vegetables. However, the cattle panels are large which means they can take a long time to set up and are hard to move around the garden. This year, Travis is going to use the new <a title=\"Hortonova Trellis Netting 48x50\" href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-48-x-50/\" target=\"_blank\">Hortonova Trellis Netting</a> which is what most commercial cucumber growers in the South use for growing. The synthetic mesh material can be used for trellising cucumbers and other vegetables either vertically or horizontally. To install vertically, use t-posts or wooden posts every 10-15 feet and to adequately secure the mesh to the stakes we use zip ties. To install horizontally, you can use 1 to 2-inch tall posts on the outside of the vegetable bed and simply stretch it across the posts to secure the mesh using zip ties. The trellis netting comes in many different sizes for all the various garden areas, but Travis just likes to get a big role and then cut it to the exact length he needs.</p>\n<h2>Trellising Cucumbers</h2>\n<p>Travis currently has a 40-foot row of cucumbers that are placed along the trellising netting. These cucumbers are just starting to climb the mesh netting in the garden area. Since cucumbers are a vining plant by establishing a stable structure like Hortonova netting we can ensure the plants will receive plenty of support throughout the growing process. In order to obtain a good stand of cucumber plants, we recommend planting seeds every 6 to 8 inches and thinning to one seed per foot in the garden spot. Overall, by trellising cucumbers not only can we maximize productivity but also reduce plant diseases by keeping them off the ground.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwKCshZwXuE?si=0_gj3v2omJ-Fit5D\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Attracting Pollinators</h2>\n<p>The reason behind attracting bees or other beneficial pollinators is the many different benefits they can provide the vegetable garden. The first benefit of attracting pollinators is the better production of plants. By transferring pollen from one flower to another flower can help plants produce healthy fruits. For crops that are self-pollinating such as corn, pollination is still very beneficial in order to help increase bountiful yields of crops for harvesting. The second advantage of attracting bees or beneficial insects is they help control pest pressures in the garden area. When pollinators are available in the garden not only are they transferring pollen but they are also eating unwanted insects that will overall reduce pest problems from the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Planting Flowers That Bees Love</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis has planted many different flower varieties that is helping when attracting bees in the vegetable garden. When attracting bees or pollinators, Travis has a designated flower area that has three different species planted on a double row to ensure he achieves maximum pollination. The first species of flowers planted is the <a title=\"Cosmos Versailles Mix\" href=\"/products/cosmos-versailles-mix/\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos Versailles Mix</a> which is a cut-flower that is a brightly-colored blend with strong stems that consistently bloom throughout the warmer months. The second species planted is the <a title=\"Benary Giant Zinnias Mix\" href=\"/products/benary-giant-zinnia-mix/\" target=\"_blank\">Benary Giant Zinnias Mix</a> which has a variety of different colorful flowers that is known for being one of the easiest cut flower varieties to grow. The third species variety is the <a title=\"Ageratum Blue Horizon\" href=\"/products/ageratum-blue-horizon/\" target=\"_blank\">Ageratum Blue Horizon</a> that creates tall, sturdy bloom clusters of vibrant blue or purplish cut-flowers. The reason behind planting these flowers on double rows is Travis is able to get maximum production in small space and he is able to suppress weeds that would otherwise take over the garden area. Travis also has a patch full of Pro-Cut Sunflowers that bees love and attract to in the vegetable garden. He recently planted a mix of several different sunflowers such as the <a title=\"ProCut White Nite Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-white-nite-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">White Nite</a>, <a title=\"ProCut Lemon Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-lemon-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">Lemon</a>, <a title=\"Joker Sunflower\" href=\"/products/joker-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">Joker</a>, <a title=\"ProCut Orange Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">Orange</a>, <a title=\"ProCut Lemon Bicolor Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-red-lemon-bicolor-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Lemon Bicolor</a>, and <a title=\"ProCut Plum Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-plum-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">Plum</a> all together and planted them using the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">garden seeder</a>. When you direct seed these varieties you are able to get a nice stand of thick sunflowers or flowers in the area. Another benefit of planting the sunflowers so dense is you are able to get a nice stratification which means you achieve blooms that come out at around 5 or 6 inches tall and some at 8 or 9 inches tall.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOjDsBJOQg8?si=XKeGCVqDbOWGsOwj\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Garden Seeder</h2>\n<p>The <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> is the ideal tool for planting various different seed sizes and accurately plant seeds without overplanting. This tool is constructed with Amish-crafted hardwood handles that contain 15-inch steel wheels and a powder-coated steel frame. It includes six different plates that vary in size for different seed varieties. The first seed plate works great for crops like broccoli, cabbage, mustard, turnips, and cauliflower. The second seed plate is ideal for crops such as onions or small coated seeds. The third seed plate is for okra and pelleted carrots, beets, or lettuce. While the fourth seed plate is made for smaller sweet corn seeds and the fifth is ideal for small beans or peas. The sixth seed plate that is used with the seeder works best for medium size beans and peas or large corn varieties. The seed plates should lay flat in the hopper to ensure they flow through the seeder properly.</p>\n<h2>Perfectly Spaced Rows</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is planting perfectly spaced rows of okra using the garden seeder. He has a 30 x 35 area that is one of the six subplots that has been established in the dream vegetable garden. When preparing the garden for perfectly spaced rows of okra plants, he is not going to use drip irrigation and is planning to direct seed. Before planting you will need to make sure the seed plate is calibrated correctly for planting and the seeds are flowing properly through the seeder. When using the third seed plate for planting okra it contains six adjustable holes and based on the seeder gearing the seed spacing should be a little over 3 inches. Then, Travis can thin them out around 8 or 12 inches to allow for plenty of room during the growing process. The planting depth for okra should be about half an inch which can be adjusted on the depth gauge located on the seeder. Travis is going to use his <a title=\"Garden Seeder Row Marker\" href=\"/products/garden-seeder-row-marker/\" target=\"_blank\">row marker</a> accessory for the seeder to ensure he gets straight planting lines in the vegetable garden. The row marker has several different spacing options and it can extend out to 36 inches or 3 feet. The row marker is going to fit and slide inside the groove that is located on the back of the garden seeder frame. Travis uses the row marker for the first row to achieve a perfectly spaced row and the rest of the rows should be straight following the first. When planting with the garden seeder a slow and steady pace is the best to ensure you get accurate seed planting. Overall, summer planting is the ideal time to grow a maximum crop of okra that is able to withstand the hottest temperatures.</p>\n<h2>Okra Varieties</h2>\n<p>The several different okra varieties that we have available are all excellent in production and flavor profiles. The first variety is the <a title=\"Jambalaya Okra\" href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Jambalaya</a> which is a hybrid that produces the most productive okra in the vegetable garden. Next, is the <a title=\"Red Burgundy Okra\" href=\"/products/red-burgundy-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Burgundy</a> which is another excellent variety that produces deep red pods that remain tender when growing longer pod lengths. The <a title=\"Silver Queen Okra\" href=\"/products/silver-queen-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Queen</a> is an heirloom variety that creates light green pods that are almost white. Another heirloom variety is the <a title=\"Cowhorn Okra\" href=\"/products/cowhorn-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Cowhorn Okra</a> that makes slender pods that remain tender even when grown at 6 to 10 inches long. However, the <a title=\"Star of David Okra\" href=\"/products/star-of-david-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Star of David</a> variety is the go-to okra for frying because of it’s thicker pods and the <a title=\"Clemson Spineless Okra\" href=\"/products/clemson-spineless-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Clemson Spineless</a> produces pods that can reach 7 to 9 inches in length and be harvested between 3 to 4 inches long. The newest okra variety that is now available is the <a title=\"Perkins Long Pod Okra\" href=\"/products/perkins-long-pod-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Perkins Long Pod</a> which is an heirloom that creates elongated pods that tend to produce early in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJPsbHy_NiA?si=pWlCFV6ARFx2Viv3\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Summer Planting: Sweet Potatoes</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is talking about how to plant and take care of sweet potatoes throughout the growing process. As a warm-weather crop, sweet potatoes are ideal for growing during the summer months because they love the hotter weather and don't mind when it is dry. In the South, summer planting sweet potatoes can be anytime in May till late August. They typically take around 100 to 120 days to mature, therefore, you will need a 3 to 4 month window of time for summer planting. Once you harvest some of the spring crops from the garden we recommend to follow up the area by starting summer planting with sweet potatoes. Unlike Irish potatoes, we plant sweet potatoes from slips which are basically a sprout from the potato that you plunk off. It contains roots on the side that once planted in the ground it will start growing leaves and start bushing out from there. You can grow your own slips from sweet potatoes that were harvested previously in the garden. However, Travis recommends buying sweet potato slips from <a title=\"Steele Plant Company\" href=\"https://www.sweetpotatoplant.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steele Plant Company</a> based in Gleason, Tennessee. When choosing a spot for planting sweet potatoes they will need plenty of room because they are a vining crop and tend to sprawl all around the soil surface. If you happen to plant the potatoes to close to another crop they will start to climb on the other crops and end up smothering them out. Once the rows are laid off using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">wheel hoe</a>, Travis will add good compost along the planting furrows before summer planting. When planting the slips they should be spaced about a foot apart in the vegetable garden. Instead of planting the slips up and down, Travis is going to plant them in the furrow horizontally and cover up almost the entire slip, leaving only a little bit sticking out. Another factor when planting sweet potatoes is they do not have to be planted on drip tape since they do not need a ton of irrigation throughout the growing season. Instead of using drip tape, Travis is going to use overhead watering to ensure he provides the plants with the needed amount of irrigation. For the first couple of days, the plants will look rather pitiful and will begin to perk up once the roots are established in the soil. Once the vines start to become more prevalent in the area you can begin to hill the sweet potatoes or throw soil to the middle of the plant rows. Travis has not found where hilling the plants makes a significant difference, but it is a great technique for weed suppression or smothering out the weeds in the garden. Another technique that he has tried is trimming back the vines as they continue to grow during the summer planting months. Travis found that when trimming the vines back it makes it easier to harvest the sweet potatoes from the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Sweet Potato Varieties</h2>\n<p>There are several different sweet potato varieties that do well in the vegetable garden. Travis has grown a couple of different potato varieties such as Beauregard and Centennial. He mentions that the sweet potato variety that does the best in production in his garden is the Covington. However, upon recommendation from Steele, Travis is going to plant the Georgia Jets which is supposed to grow really well in the south. All of these sweet potato varieties have excellent storage life and are ideal for summer planting.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpI-jhg3akk?si=L58Wlr8uS8Sx9PWq\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:25-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Replenishing Garden Soil</h2>\n<p>To have improved garden soils using cover crops can help replenish the area by increasing organic matter, suppress nematode populations, control weed germination, and improve overall soil tilth. When building up the garden soils you should supply the best cover crop that fulfills the characteristics you are wanting to replenish in the soil and incorporate the needed compounds back into the soil properly to better fulfill the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Cover Crop: Sunn Hemp</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is discussing the best cover crop to use when you need to replenish the garden soil. The best warm-season cover crop that adds many benefits to the garden soil is known as <a title=\"Sunn Hemp\" href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunn Hemp</a>. This variety is a legume which means it is related to crops like peas and peanuts. This cover crop allows you to add a significant amount of nitrogen, suppress weeds, and quality organic matter into the garden soil. However, compared to other warm-season varieties the Sunn Hemp is the only nitrogen fixer cover crop. As a nitrogen fixer, it is able to grab nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into your garden soil. This fixer is important in the garden because when you get rid of the cover crop you will gain lots of available nitrogen for the next vegetable crop you plant in that area. Some recent studies have shown that Sunn Hemp can fix up to 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre which is excellent when planting heavy feeder crops like onions and corn. Sunn Hemp should be planted when soil temperatures are around 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When planting it can be broadcasted or with a precision planter like the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">garden seeder</a>. This warm-season cover crop grows extremely fast and typically reaches maturity in 8 to 12 weeks. This cover crop variety is pretty much maintenance-free and does not take a lot of effort to grow in the area. Since it grows so quickly it suppresses weed pressures by outpacing weed germination which is a major benefit in the vegetable garden. Like all cover crops, Sunn Hemp should be cut or mowed before it reaches seed to prevent reseeding issues in the future growing seasons.</p>\n<h2>Warm Season Cover Crop Varieties</h2>\n<p>Along with Sunn Hemp, there are three other cover crop varieties that we have available that beneficial characteristics for the garden soil as well. The <a title=\"Brown Top Millet\" href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\">Brown Top Millet</a> provides ideal ground cover for weed suppression and for adding organic matter back into the soil. This tall bunching grass can reach up to 12 feet high and usually matures within 60 to 70 days. As a millet, this green manure can add a significant amount of organic matter to depleted soils which can improve soil quality and tilth. Next, is <a title=\"Buckwheat\" href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\">Buckwheat</a> which is another fast-growing cover crop that is ideal for planting in small windows between fall and spring plantings. It works best for weed suppression and provides organic matter that helps loosen up the topsoil making it more workable and increases soil drainage for planting. The best warm-season cover crop for reducing nematode populations is <a title=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>. As a bunching grass, the sudangrass creates a dense mat of tall vegetation similar to corn, but with smaller leaf blades. When mowing down or decomposing the cover crop vegetation it releases natural compounds that are suppressive to nematode populations. We recommend using the sudangrass as a transition crop between spring and fall planting.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ssj-mgz02Kg?si=qHEo27Xs48XHcI4R\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>The Dream Vegetable Garden</h2>\n<p>Every gardener imagines having a dream vegetable garden that is designed and laid out to fit your ideal gardening needs on the homestead. This past year, Travis has established a new area on his homestead that is designed as his dream vegetable garden. The dream garden is designed with six subplots that are all around 30 x 35 in size. The subplots are important to ensure that the area can be more manageable and workable. Another benefit of subplots is the ability to move crops around the plots to establish a steady crop rotation system and avoid harsh pest and disease pressures.</p>\n<h2>Producing Any Crops in the Garden</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is doing a walk around the dream garden to show whether any crops are growing or working well in the area. Since the dream vegetable garden is a new area that is being managed and worked on the soil is harder to work with because it has never been used to grow any crops on. To get the area more workable, Travis will need to grow some beneficial cover crops, add some organic matter, and adjust the pH levels in the soil. The first subplot that was planted on in the vegetable garden was potatoes. Since it was the first crop to be planted he has already harvested and stored all the early varieties of potatoes such as the red potatoes, purple, and the <a title=\"Yukon Gold Potato\" href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukon Gold</a>. However, in the garden area, there are still three rows of <a title=\"German Butterball Potato\" href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">German Butterball</a> potatoes to be harvested. As the potato varieties are harvested, Travis comes in with the tiller to level out the soil after digging potatoes so it will be prepared for the next crop to be planted soon. On the second plot, all of the cucurbits are planted such as summer squash and cucumbers. The summer squash is planted in the middle, while the cucumbers are planted on the cattle panels along the outside of the plot. In the garden, there is one row of the <a title=\"Calypso Cucumber\" href=\"/products/calypso-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\">Calypso</a> pickling cucumbers and one row of the <a title=\"Stonewall Cucumber\" href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\">Stonewall</a> variety which is slicing cucumbers. The summer squash have done well in the plot except for a few that were lost due to disease problems that need to be controlled better in the future. However, Travis has been able to harvest a pretty good amount of summer squash and cucumbers from the vegetable garden. In the next plot, he has <a title=\"Rattlesnake Pole Beans\" href=\"/products/rattlesnake-pole-bean/\" target=\"_blank\">Rattlesnake Pole Beans</a> on a trellis as well as indeterminate and determinate tomatoes. The <a title=\"Sun Gold Tomato\" href=\"/products/sun-gold-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Sun Gold Tomatoes</a> are producing an excellent cluster of tomatoes at the base of the plant and are continuing to produce along the rows. Travis has three rows of determinate tomatoes such as <a title=\"Mountain Glory Tomato\" href=\"/products/mountain-glory-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Mountain Glory</a>, <a title=\"Brickyard Tomato\" href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Brickyard</a>, and <a title=\"Bella Rosa Tomato\" href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Bella Rosa</a> varieties all on the Florida Weave trellis. In the south, it can be kind of tough to grow tomatoes because of the high disease pressures, but they are producing really well so far in the vegetable garden. In the fourth plot, Travis is growing peppers and eggplants which are part of the nightshade family. He just established new stakes for trellising and added wheat straw to help manage the weed pressures. While in the fifth plot there is <a title=\"Incredible Sweet Corn\" href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\">Incredible Sweet Corn</a> growing and the six plot contains winter squash which includes the <a title=\"Small Wonder Spaghetti Squash\" href=\"/products/small-wonder-spaghetti-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Small Wonder Spaghetti</a> and the <a title=\"Hai Kabocha Squash\" href=\"/products/hai-kabocha-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Hai Kabocha</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LhWQoLXlrw?si=fpjXJ7pPhSgevRwp\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "title": "How to Adjust Your Wheel Hoe Handles to Fit You",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:23-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Wheel Hoe Handles</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis explains how to adjust wheel hoe handles to fit you perfectly. The new accessory that makes it easy to adjust the wheel hoe handles is the <a href=\"/products/offset-handle-bracket/\" title=\"Offset Handle Bracket\" data-mce-href=\"/products/offset-handle-bracket/\" target=\"_blank\">offset handle brackets</a>. The handle bracket kit allows you to shift the wheel hoe or garden seeder handles to the left or right so you don't have to work directly behind the tool. This offset handle kit works with the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" data-mce-href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Wheel Hoe,</a> <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" data-mce-href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a>, <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" title=\"High Arch Wheel Hoe\" data-mce-href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a>, and the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" title=\"Garden Seeder\" data-mce-href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Seeder</a>. The first step to installing the offset brackets you simply remove the handles that are already on the wheel hoe or seeder by using a 7/16 wrench. Once the handles are off we can install the offset brackets by aligning them with the slotted groove that is already established which allows us to move the handles up and down and still have the functionality needed with the tool. Travis simply takes the bolts that are included with the kit and installs the offset brackets so they can either kick out to the right or left. It is important not to tighten the bolts all the way down because he still wants to figure out where his handle height needs to be. Then, once the handles are installed we can adjust the handles to our desired height and tighten the bolts on the offset brackets. Another important thing to remember when installing the offset handles is to make sure the brackets are kicking out in the same direction to ensure the handles are going to match up. When the offset brackets are installed it is time to add the handles in the top slots of the brackets. Travis is going to use the two square spots because he does not want the handles too far back on the wheel hoe or seeder. However, if you do want the handles farther back you can use the diamond-shaped spots on the bracket. Once the handles are added to the brackets and tight, then he can tighten down the bolts to set his handle height. When everything is set up it is time to place it in the garden and get to work along the rows.</p>\n<h2>Handle Types</h2>\n<p>The three different types of wheel hoe handles that we offer are the pistol grip, steam-bent, and stock plow handles. The <a href=\"/products/pistol-grip-handles/\" title=\"Pistol Grip Handles\" data-mce-href=\"/products/pistol-grip-handles/\" target=\"_blank\">Pistol Grip Handles</a> are designed with a fat end so the handle fits directly in the palm of your hand for pushing the tool through the garden soil.

    "title": "Everything You Need to Know for Growing Sweet Corn",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:23-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Incredible Sweet Corn Variety</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis explains the many different tasks of growing sweet corn. Travis previously planted a sweet corn variety known as <a title=\"Incredible Sweet Corn\" href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\">Incredible</a> which is sugary enhanced that has a higher sugar content than other standard varieties allowing it to have excellent flavor profiles. Another benefit of this variety is it contains a great disease package and improved storage than older heirloom varieties. He planted the sweet corn using the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Seeder</a> and spaced them about 4 to 6 inches apart since they were planted on drip tape.</p>\n<h2>Hilling, Side-Dressing, &amp; Fertilizing Sweet Corn</h2>\n<p>The first major reason behind hilling sweet corn is for weed suppression. By using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and cultivating between the rows of corn you are able to keep the weeds down. By smothering out the weeds between the plants you are reducing weed pressures because they cannot get sunlight or continue to grow and will end up dying in the garden. The second reason for hilling sweet corn is for better plant stabilization. By throwing soil up around the sweet corn it ensures that the plants are stabilized and it will be less likely that harsh wind or rain will cause your crops to lean over. It also allows the roots to grip into the soil a little bit better throughout the growing sweet corn process. The third reason for hilling is for better side-dressing and applying granular fertilizer to the sweet corn. When it comes to side-dressing corn the first step is to simply apply granular fertilizer to the side of the plants along the garden row. Then, take a wheel hoe and cover the fertilizer up while throwing soil to the corn for plant stabilization and weed suppression. The ideal tool for hilling is the <a title=\"High Arch Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a title=\"Wheel Hoes\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\">plow set</a> attachment in the hilling position. The high arch has a gap or space between the two toolbars and the wheels which allows you to easily straddle the rows to throw soil to both sides of the plants in one pass through along the rows. Another benefit to this wheel hoe is the 15-inch clearance that allows you to straddle even the taller plants as they continue to grow. When it comes to the fertilizer or mainly nitrogen requirements for sweet corn it is recommended that 250 lbs per acre of nitrogen is needed throughout the life of the plant. However, since most gardeners are growing sweet corn on a smaller acre, Travis suggests about 5.7 lbs of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet. Travis recommends spoon-feeding throughout the entire life of the plant, therefore instead of giving them five and a half pounds of nitrogen at one time he will break that up and give them around half increments about 4 to 5 times. Travis uses three sources of nitrogen when growing sweet corn which is chicken manure, Chilean nitrate, and 20-20-20 garden fertilizer. He places the chicken manure compost down beside the plants for his first nitrogen application. For the second spoon-feeding he will use the <a title=\"Chilean Nitrate Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">Chilean Nitrate</a> as a side-dress because it is a natural source of high nitrogen and it has a little granulated form that makes it easier to sprinkle around the plants. For a 1,000 square foot plot if the entire bag of Chilean nitrate is used it will give the area 1.5 pounds of actual nitrogen which is just the right amount for spoon-feeding sweet corn. All that's left is to provide three pounds of nitrogen using the <a title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">20-20-20</a> garden fertilizer. Travis simply uses the 20-20-20 in the <a title=\"EZ Flo Fertilizer Injector\" href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\" target=\"_blank\">fertilizer injector</a> which runs through the drip system in the vegetable garden. Overall, when growing sweet corn is very important to hill, side-dress, and fertilize throughout the growing stages of corn to ensure you get maximum production and healthy plants.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9r21qLanfkM?si=t12wYRre5-hlpViu\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:22-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Plant Cut Flowers in the Vegetable Garden?</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of different benefits behind interplanting cut flowers such as sunflowers in the vegetable garden. The first benefit is it will increase the presence of beneficial insects which helps control harmful pests from taking over the area. However, the most important reason for interplanting flowers is it will increase the presence of pollinators and maximize the number of healthy plants producing along the rows. This will in return give us a bountiful harvest of healthy crops in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Planting Sunflowers in the Garden</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis explains the best way to plant sunflowers in the vegetable garden area. Travis has grown ProCut sunflower varieties for around 4 to 5 years. When planting sunflowers the best tool to use is the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> which comes with adjustable seed plates that make planting different seed sizes easy along the row. To get the perfect seed plate for planting ProCut varieties Travis simply takes an existing seed plate and modifies it to match the seed size of the sunflower variety. The seed plate he is using to plant has 6 holes which are a little over 3 inches in spacing since Travis prefers to plant sunflowers thick. Once the seed plate is customized to your preferred hole spacing and seed size it is time to ensure the seeds are running through the seed plate properly within the seeder. Before planting with the seeder, Travis must take the <a title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> with a 12-inch <a title=\"Oscillating Hoe\" href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">oscillating hoe</a> to cultivate the area a couple of inches and make the area more workable prior to planting sunflower seeds. When planting the seeds he places them around 2 to 3 feet apart and is going to use overhead watering instead of drip tape in the garden.</p>\n<h2>Sunflower Varieties</h2>\n<p>ProCut sunflowers are the preferred variety of sunflower that is used by all the professional cut flower gardeners. These sunflower varieties will reach around 6 to 7 feet tall and each plant produces a single stem or one flower in the garden. Another benefit of the ProCut varieties of sunflowers is they are pollen-less which means they don't have any pollen. Therefore, when you harvest the sunflowers and place them in a vase they will not deposit pollen all over the place like traditional sunflowers. There are 6 different color variation varieties that we have available this year. The first variety is the <a title=\"ProCut Orange Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">ProCut Orange</a> which produces bright orange petals with dark brown disk center. Next, is the <a title=\"ProCut Lemon Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-lemon-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">ProCut Lemon</a> which creates beautiful lemon-colored petals similar to the traditional yellow sunflower. Another unusual pretty variety is the <a title=\"ProCut Red Lemon Bicolor Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-red-lemon-bicolor-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">ProCut Red Lemon Bicolor</a> which is a bicolor that has red to yellow petals. The <a title=\"ProCut White Nite Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-white-nite-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">White Nite</a> produces solid vanilla-colored petals that make the vegetable garden pop with color. The fifth variety we offer is a <a title=\"ProCut Red Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-red-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">ProCut Red</a> which contains deep burgundy petals. While the last variety we have available is the <a title=\"ProCut Plum Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-plum-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">ProCut Plum</a> which is another bicolor that creates plum to cream-colored petals.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wPSIReXZYU?si=4Trz8gqk-Hby0FH-\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Dream Vegetable Garden</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis shows off the finished dream vegetable garden. Travis has designed and laid out a new area on his homestead that is his ideal dream vegetable garden. He is going to go over every variety that he planted in the area today.</p>\n<h3>Irish Potatoes</h3>\n<p>He started off in February planting Irish potatoes such as the Adirondack Blue, German Butterball, Red Norland, and Yukon Gold. The <a title=\"Adirondack Blue Potato\" href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Adirondack Blue</a> contains a purple flesh potato that is rich in antioxidants that offer exceptional yields and excellent flavor. Unlike other potato varieties, the best flavor profile is the <a title=\"German Butterball Potato\" href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">German Butterball</a> which contains a buttery-yellow flesh. The <a title=\"Red Norland Potato\" href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Norland</a> is a newer variety that has disease resistant to scab, late blight, and potato virus. This is another variety that has a great yield, storage, and flavor profile. The <a title=\"Yukon Gold Potato\" href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukon Gold</a> is another popular variety that has been a favorite for gardeners for many years.</p>\n<h3>Summer Squash &amp; Cucumbers</h3>\n<p>Next, he planted the summer squash and two cucumber varieties which consisted of a pickling and slicing type. The <a title=\"Goldprize Squash\" href=\"/products/goldprize-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldprize Squash</a> variety is a hybrid straightneck that produces bountiful yellow fruits that contain an excellent disease package. The next squash variety is the <a title=\"Sunburst Squash\" href=\"/products/sunburst-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunburst</a> which is known as a “patty pan” that produces bright yellow fruits with scalloped edges and green rings in the center interior. While the Bennings Green was another “patty pan” variety. He planted two varieties of zucchini which were <a title=\"Spineless Beauty Zucchini\" href=\"/products/spineless-beauty-zucchini/\" target=\"_blank\">Spineless Beauty</a> and <a title=\"Golden Delight Zucchini\" href=\"/products/golden-delight-zucchini/\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Delight</a>. While the cucumbers that were planted were two of the most productive varieties known as <a title=\"Calypso Cucumber\" href=\"/products/calypso-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\">Calypso</a> and <a title=\"Stonewall Cucumber\" href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\">Stonewall</a>.</p>\n<h3>Tomatoes</h3>\n<p>He planted both indeterminate and determinate tomato varieties in the dream vegetable garden. For the indeterminate tomatoes, he planted the <a title=\"Brandywine Pink Tomato\" href=\"/products/brandywine-pink-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Brandywine</a> variety using the tomato cages to help support the plants as they continue to grow larger. For the determinate tomatoes such as the <a title=\"Bella Rosa Tomato\" href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Bella Rosa</a> and <a title=\"Brickyard Tomato\" href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\">Brickyard</a>, he planted those using the Florida Weave Technique.</p>\n<h3>Sweet Corn</h3>\n<p>The outstanding sweet corn variety that he planted using the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">garden seeder</a> was the <a title=\"Incredible Sweet Corn\" href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\">Incredible Sweet Corn</a>. This is a sugary enhanced variety that has a higher sugar content than other standard varieties allowing it to have excellent flavor profiles. It contains a traditional yellow corn appearance with a great disease resistance package and improved storage life. The sweet corn has done really well and has reached around 6 to 8 inches tall in the vegetable garden. He also side dressed those recently with chicken manure compost and soon he will hill the plants to ensure they have plenty of stability as they continue to grow.</p>\n<h3>Winter Squash</h3>\n<p>Another crop he planted in the garden was winter squash which consisted of planting the Small Wonder Spaghetti Squash and Kabocha Squash. The spaghetti squash variety is a personalized size fruit that is extremely productive and produces around 10 to 15 fruits per plant. While the kabocha squash is the best-tasting squash around it is also known for its texture and visual appearance. Those two varieties have both done extremely well in germinating and all but two seeds didn't germinate, so almost 100% germination.</p>\n<h3>Peppers</h3>\n<p>When it comes to planting peppers in the dream vegetable garden, Travis planted almost every variety that we have available because he loves growing peppers. The <a title=\"Bayonet Bell Pepper\" href=\"/products/bayonet-bell-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Bayonet Bell Pepper</a> is a consistently sized blocky pepper that is really productive and contains an excellent disease package. While the <a title=\"Merlot Purple Bell Pepper\" href=\"/products/merlot-purple-bell-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Merlot Purple Bell Pepper</a> is a hybrid that starts growing as green but matures to a deep purple color when ready to harvest. The <a title=\"Aruba Cubanelle Pepper\" href=\"/products/aruba-cubanelle-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Aruba Cubanelle Pepper</a> contains a blend of mild heat and sweet flavor that is a very productive variety. The next variety is <a title=\"Gold Rush Banana Pepper\" href=\"/products/gold-rush-banana-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Gold Rush Banana Pepper</a> which is a popular sweet pepper that matures to an orange and red color variation in the garden. Then, on the more mild heat flavor pepper row, he planted <a title=\"Tiburon Poblano Pepper\" href=\"/products/tiburon-poblano-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Poblano</a>, <a title=\"Anaheim Pepper\" href=\"/products/anaheim-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Anaheim</a>, and <a title=\"Beaver Dam Hot Pepper\" href=\"/products/beaver-dam-hot-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Beaver Dam</a>. Lastly, in the final row, he planted the hotter varieties such as <a title=\"Jalapeno Pepper\" href=\"/products/jalapeno-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Jalapenos</a>, <a title=\"Serrano Pepper\" href=\"/products/serrano-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Serrano</a>, <a title=\"Brazilian Orchid Pepper\" href=\"/products/brazilian-orchid-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Brazilian Orchid</a>, and <a title=\"Long Slim Cayenne Peppers\" href=\"/products/long-slim-cayenne-pepper/\" target=\"_blank\">Cayenne Peppers</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFjz7Q_vvLY?si=oRxniOTyNCi_kApk\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:21-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Cut Flowers Before Planting?</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis explains one thing to consider before planting in the vegetable garden. The ultimate goal when growing your own vegetables is to produce the healthiest crops you can. One way to get a maximum crop of healthy plants is to grow cut flowers. For crops such as cucumbers, summer squash, watermelons, and winter squash they all require pollinators. It is important to attract pollinators to ensure you get an increase in productive vegetables. For a couple of years, Travis has interplanted cut flowers along his vegetable garden and it has done extremely well. Another benefit of growing cut flowers is the ability to easily harvest or cut the stems and place them in a vase.</p>\n<h2>Cut Flower Varieties</h2>\n<p>The first cut flower variety is <a title=\"Ageratum Blue Horizon\" href=\"/products/ageratum-blue-horizon/\" target=\"_blank\">Ageratum Blue Horizon</a> which is a bright-colored flower that produces tall sturdy bloom clusters that make the vegetable garden blossom with color. The <a title=\"Cosmos Versailles Mix\" href=\"/products/cosmos-versailles-mix/\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos Versailles Mix</a> is another brightly colored blend of cut flowers that produces a mix of pink, white, and red blooms. There are several different ProCut Sunflowers that are the preferred cut flower varieties. These sunflower varieties include <a title=\"ProCut White Nite Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-white-nite-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">White Nite</a>, <a title=\"ProCut Lemon Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-lemon-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">Lemon</a>, <a title=\"ProCut Orange Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">Orange</a>, and <a title=\"ProCut Red Sunflower\" href=\"/products/procut-red-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\">Red</a>. However, one of the easiest cut flower varieties to grow is zinnias. We carry the <a title=\"Benary Giant Zinnia Mix\" href=\"/products/benary-giant-zinnia-mix/\" target=\"_blank\">Benary Giant Zinnia Mix</a> that includes yellow, orange, purple, coral, lime and several different red variations.</p>\n<h2>Growing Cut Flowers</h2>\n<p>Before planting cut flowers we prepare the garden by using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> in the furrowing position. Next, make a furrow to create a row and bury the drip tape in the furrow. Then, you can go along the tape and scatter the seeds along both sides of the tape to get a double row of plants. If you're not using the <a title=\"Drip Tape Layer Attachment\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\">drip tape layer attachment</a> and reusing drip tape to easily cover it up you should let the emitters fill up to keep it in place while burying in the garden. To bury the drip tape, Travis takes the <a title=\"High Arch Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> in the hilling position to simply cover the tape along the row. If you prefer not to direct seed, you can also use the <a title=\"Seed Starting Trays\" href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\" target=\"_blank\">seed starting trays </a>to create transplants for cut flowers. When planting the cut flower transplants he places the in-row spacing around 6 to 8 inches apart in the vegetable garden. Once, the flowers start blooming it is important to come in the garden and prune the flower heads that have dried up or started to go to seed. If you properly prune the cut flowers they will continue to produce blooms all throughout the warmer months.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lnLkjgepsIw?si=i25rMKIAZQt3KhKp\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:21-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Key Reasons for Growing Winter Squash</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is explaining the key factors in growing winter squash in the vegetable garden. In the dream garden, he is going to plant one of his favorite crops to grow which is winter squash. The first major reason for growing winter squash is it can be easy to manage because it doesn't require a lot of weeding or constant care. Once the plants start to germinate and grow they'll create a nice dense canopy over the entire plot. You might have to weed it a little bit with the <a title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> until the plants become large enough to cover the plot with the canopy to shade out the weeds. Overall, it is a great productive crop that needs little to no maintenance in the vegetable garden. The second reason for growing winter squash is it's a one-time harvest crop. Unlike summer squash, which must be harvested two to three times a week, the winter squash can be harvested all at once from the garden. The third reason behind growing winter squash is the storage life capacity. Once harvesting all the winter squash it can be stored underneath a well-covered area such as a barn and placed on a drying rack to store for up to six months.</p>\n<h2>Planting Winter Squash</h2>\n<p>When it comes to winter squash the ideal time for planting is during the Spring and they typically take between 90 to 100 days to fully mature. Therefore, we harvest them in the middle of summer and they store on into the winter months. Similar to summer squash and cucumbers, winter squash is susceptible to diseases such as powdery mildew and downy mildew. To help alleviate these disease problems you can add a <a title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">drip irrigation</a> system to ensure water is being added directly to the plant roots instead of using overhead irrigation that can cause excessive leaf moisture. The two varieties that Travis is going to plant this year is <a title=\"Small Wonder Spaghetti Squash\" href=\"/products/small-wonder-spaghetti-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Small Wonder Spaghetti Squash</a> and <a title=\"Hai Kabocha Squash\" href=\"/products/hai-kabocha-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Hai Kabocha Squash</a>. The spaghetti squash variety is a personalized size fruit that is extremely productive and produces around 10 to 15 fruits per plant. While the kabocha squash is the best-tasting squash around it is also known for its texture and visual appearance. Travis is going to plant the crops on four-foot row spacing to ensure he gets a dense canopy by the vegetation and blocks all the weeds. To prepare the garden, he makes a furrow with the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and <a title=\"Wheel Hoes\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\">plow set</a> attachment. Then, he buries the drip tape and plants the winter squash seeds on top of the drip irrigation in the garden area. When winter squash is ready for harvesting they will begin to die back and the fruits will obtain their full color. Once stems harden, this is another indication that the winter squash is fully mature and ready for harvest in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZScODaFTIE?si=p3-B6qlQYgOcDd8Y\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "title": "A Few Simple Tips to Grow a Maximum Okra Crop",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:21-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting an Okra Crop</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is growing a productive okra crop in the vegetable garden. You can typically plant around two or three crops of okra from spring to fall. Throughout the warm growing season, it is best to succession plant okra to ensure you can get maximum yields for harvesting. In the Spring, Travis always likes to transplant an okra crop to get a headstart on the growing season. By transplanting you are able to get around a two to four-week head start in the vegetable garden instead of direct seeding. To get the best transplants he recommends planting in <a title=\"24 Cell Seed Starting Kit\" href=\"/products/24-cell-seed-starting-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">seed starting trays</a> to ensure you develop a solid root ball with internal root training ribs that help the plants grow properly and reduce transplant shock. If you are in a tight space in the area it is best to plant okra on double rows so you can easily harvest both rows at once. This year Travis is going to plant on a single row with three-foot row spacing. When going to prune okra instead of cutting it off right below the pod, Travis prefers to cut the pod and the lateral branch because it will keep the bottom of the plant clean and easier to see when it comes time for harvesting. Unlike other crops, okra is not a heavy feeder and does not require lots of irrigation or fertilizer. However, we still suggest planting okra on <a title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">drip tape</a> because the plants can have a tendency to strike-off when it becomes dry during the summer months. Once the vegetable garden is set up and prepared for planting, all that's left is to plant the okra transplants and wait for them to grow.</p>\n<h2>Harvesting Okra</h2>\n<p>The best time to harvest okra pods is when they reach around 3 to 5 inches in length. However, once okra plants get so tall they become less productive and harvesting will be more difficult. A major pest that can harm the growth of okra plants is root-knot nematodes. Which can cause knots on the roots of the plants that can drain the nutrients from the plants leaving them wilted in the vegetable garden. There are a couple of different ways to control these nematode problems in the garden area. Travis recommends using a cover crop such as <a title=\"Broadleaf Mustard\" href=\"/products/broadleaf-mustard/\" target=\"_blank\">Broadleaf Mustard</a> that will release chemicals to help suppress nematode, fungi, and insect populations and increase organic matter which will improve soil tilth and quality of the soil structure in the vegetable garden area.</p>\n<h2>Okra Varieties</h2>\n<p>The first variety is the <a title=\"Jambalaya Okra\" href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Jambalaya</a> which is a hybrid that produces the most productive okra in the vegetable garden. Another excellent variety is known as <a title=\"Red Burgundy Okra\" href=\"/products/red-burgundy-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Burgundy</a> which produces deep red pods that remain tender when growing longer pod lengths. The <a title=\"Silver Queen Okra\" href=\"/products/silver-queen-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Queen</a> is an heirloom variety that creates light green pods that are almost white. Another heirloom variety is the <a title=\"Cowhorn Okra\" href=\"/products/cowhorn-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Cowhorn Okra</a> that makes slender pods that remain tender even when grown at 6 to 10 inches long. When it comes to the <a title=\"Star of David Okra\" href=\"/products/star-of-david-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Star of David</a> variety it is the go-to okra for frying because of it's thicker pods. However, the standard okra variety is the <a title=\"Clemson Spineless Okra\" href=\"/products/clemson-spineless-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Clemson Spineless</a> that produces pods that can reach 7 to 9 inches in length and be harvested at between 3 to 4 inches long. The newest okra variety we have available is the <a title=\"Perkins Long Pod Okra\" href=\"/products/perkins-long-pod-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Perkins Long Pod</a> that creates elongated pods that tend to produce early in the garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/giy6BE7Sc_Q?si=PL0sUxVJZLtb0ekK\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Incredible Sweet Corn</h2>\n<p>The outstanding new sweet corn variety being planted in the garden is the <a title=\"Incredible Sweet Corn\" href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\">Incredible Sweet Corn</a>. This sugary enhanced variety has a higher sugar content than other standard varieties allowing it to have excellent flavor profiles. It contains a traditional yellow corn appearance with a great disease resistance package. Another benefit of this variety is it has an improved storage life than older heirloom varieties.</p>\n<h2>Planting a Sweet Corn Variety</h2>\n<p>When it comes to planting sweet corn there are three common mistakes that people making in the vegetable garden. The first mistake is planting sweet corn in long rows instead of square plots. It's important to plant corn in square plots to ensure you get the most wind pollination that will in return give you full ears of corn and the best harvest. The second mistake is not enough water during the growing season. Since sweet corn is heavy-feeders they need plenty of water throughout the entire growing process of the plant. We suggest planting corn on <a title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">drip tape</a> to provide plenty of irrigation directly to the plant roots where they need it most along the row. The third mistake is corn also needs plenty of fertilizer especially nitrogen. By applying the fertilizer using the drip system and <a title=\"EZ Flo Fertilizer Injector\" href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\" target=\"_blank\">fertilizer injector</a> we can use <a title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">20-20-20</a> or <a title=\"Chilean Nitrate Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">Chilean Nitrate</a> to help incorporate the needed nutrients into the soil. You can also side-dress the Chilean Nitrate or some good compost along beside the plants and incorporate it in that way as well. Travis is planting the sweet corn on three-foot row spacing to allow room as the plants continue to grow. After preparing the garden area, he is going to use the <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Seeder</a> to help plant the seeds along the row. Before planting with the seeder, he first has to make sure the seed plate is calibrated correctly for the sweet corn variety being planted. This means the holes on the seed plate needs to be the correct size for planting the seeds. Next, we test the seed plate in the garden seeder to ensure they are flowing perfectly through the seeder and into the soil. Once the seed plate is perfect, then it's time to set the desired planting depth. Once everything is calibrated correctly it is time to plant the Incredible sweet corn variety in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Harvesting Sweet Corn</h2>\n<p>The best time to harvest sweet corn is once the tassels begin to turn brown and the cobs are fully matured. To harvest simply hold the ear firmly, pull down, and twist. When storing corn the best way is in the refrigerator, where it keeps for up to a week. If you prefer to store corn for a longer period, you can place it in the freezer.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KT4Mjbzn54E?si=qnc9rfd0UPa4XiSj\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "title": "Growing a Maximum Carrot Crop in the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:20-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Carrots</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is growing a maximum carrot crop in a tight space in the vegetable garden. When planting a carrot crop on double rows with drip irrigation it has always worked well and we have received a bountiful harvest in the Spring garden for several years. Travis suggests planting carrots in the fall towards the end of October when temperatures are cooler which lets us overwinter and harvest them in the spring. Also, we can succession plant carrots in the spring around February to harvest before the warm weather comes towards May. Unlike other crops, carrots take a long time to germinate, so if you experience heavy weed pressures that can be a major problem when growing carrots. When it comes to heavy weeds in the garden this creates major issues because weeds will compete with carrots for nutrients in the soil. The first step to planting carrots is by using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a title=\"Wheel Hoes\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\">plow set</a> to help create furrows along the row where the drip tape will be laid in the area. Travis recommends using <a title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> to ensure the carrots get an adequate amount of irrigation and fertilizer directly to the plant roots where they need it most. Before adding drip tape, Travis likes to add a good quality compost down to help supply nutrients in the soil before planting. To incorporate the drip he runs the <a title=\"Drip Tape Layer Attachment\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\">drip tape layer attachment</a> along the furrows so he can bury the drip tape and cover it in one pass through. Once the carrot seeds are planted, Travis is going to take a rake and lightly cover them along the row in the garden. Another important key to planting carrots to save space and maximum crops is by planting them thick along the garden rows.</p>\n<h2>Harvesting Carrots</h2>\n<p>Different carrot crop varieties can be harvested at various times. Therefore, it is easy to come in the vegetable garden and pick a few as you need them, so you don't have to worry about gathering them all at once. Another thing about overwintering carrots is they're going to take a lot longer to mature than the listed maturity date. When storing carrots, Travis just grabs a handful of carrots to place them in a bag with one end open so the carrot tops are free and then place them in a fridge. Once in the fridge, the carrots can store really well for two to three weeks and sometimes even longer.</p>\n<h2>Carrot Crop Varieties</h2>\n<p>The <a title=\"Bolero Carrot\" href=\"/products/bolero-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Bolero Carrot</a> variety is an exceptional hybrid that is not only disease-resistant but has a great flavor profile. While the <a title=\"Yellowstone Carrots\" href=\"/products/yellowstone-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Yellowstone</a> is an open-pollinated variety that produces large yellow carrots with vigorous tops. Another variety is the <a title=\"Purple Haze Carrot\" href=\"/products/purple-haze-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Purple Haze</a> which is visually appealing with a dark purple exterior and orange interior in the vegetable garden. However, the <a title=\"Deep Purple Carrot Pelleted\" href=\"/products/deep-purple-carrot-pelleted/\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Purple</a> variety is another purple carrot that is present throughout the exterior and interior of the carrot crop. The <a title=\"Danvers 126 Carrot\" href=\"/products/danvers-126-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Danvers 126</a> is the traditional bugs bunny carrot that has broad shoulders and a strong taper to a sharp tip. The two new varieties of carrots we have available is <a title=\"Black Nebula Carrot\" href=\"/products/black-nebula-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Nebula</a> and <a title=\"Chantenay Royal Carrot\" href=\"/products/chantenay-royal-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Chantenay Royal</a>. </p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDHJm8bcreU?si=jHsZmGGcYSBnRUXj\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:20-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Squash and Cucumbers</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis plants a bumper crop of squash and cucumbers in the garden area. The first step in planting a bumper crop is to mark off the rows and lay the drip irrigation in the desired area. Travis has a 30 by 35-foot wide subplot area and is going to lay six rows that have five-feet spacing. To lay down the rows and drip irrigation, Travis is going to use the F.A.D. system which is furrow, amend, and drip. He will take the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wheel Hoes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plow set</a> and create a furrow in a straight line where the rows will lay. Next, take a good quality compost and lightly sprinkle it along the garden furrows. Then, with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drip Tape Layer Attachment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drip tape layer attachment</a>, he will lay the drip tape in the furrows while covering it up at the same time which will give us buried irrigation and compost that will give our plants plenty of nutrients throughout the growing season. For any kind of plant that needs trellising, Travis likes to use galvanized cattle panels that you can get from any kind of hardwood store. He uses t-posts on the ends and middle to help support the cattle panels along the 30-foot row using zip ties. Another thing to remember about trellising cucumbers is to plant them along the edge of the subplot because they tend to sprawl out along the garden. Therefore, if you plant the cucumbers in the middle of the garden they will end up crawling all over your other plants.</p>\n<h2>Squash and Cucumber Varieties</h2>\n<p>The first bumper crop of squash that is going to be planted is the <a href=\"/products/goldprize-squash/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Goldprize Squash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goldprize</a> variety. This is a hybrid straightneck variety that produces bountiful yellow fruits that contain an excellent disease package. The next squash variety being planted is the <a href=\"/products/sunburst-squash/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sunburst Squash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sunburst</a> which is known as a \"patty pan\" that produces bright yellow fruits with scalloped edges and green rings in the center interior. Another \"patty pan\" variety being planted is an heirloom known as <a href=\"/products/bennings-green-tint-squash/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bennings Green Tint Squash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bennings Green</a>. This is a productive variety that produces light green fruits with scalloped edges as well. The two varieties of zucchini that are going to be planted in the garden is <a href=\"/products/spineless-beauty-zucchini/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Spineless Beauty Zucchini\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spineless Beauty</a> and <a href=\"/products/golden-delight-zucchini/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Golden Delight Zucchini\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Golden Delight</a>. When it comes to planting cucumbers the two most productive varieties is <a href=\"/products/calypso-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Calypso Cucumber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calypso</a> and <a href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Stonewall Cucumber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stonewall</a>. Both of these cucumber varieties are gynoecious meaning they only produce female flowers which makes them extremely productive in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Controlling Fungal Diseases</h2>\n<p>An important aspect of growing squash and cucumbers is fungal diseases such as powdery mildew and downy mildew can become a problem. One thing that will feed these diseases is excessive leaf moisture so to control this moisture he likes to use certain spray treatments such as the <a href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Liquid Copper Fungicide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liquid Copper</a> or <a href=\"/products/complete-disease-control/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Complete Disease Control\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Complete Disease Control</a>. However, the major key to eliminating leaf moisture is using drip irrigation instead of overhead watering in the garden. When using <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drip tape</a> you can ensure that the water is going directly to the plant roots where the crops need it the most and not on the leaves caused by overhead watering. In the end, we will have fewer disease problems and healthier plants in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBW1KHFVwlU?si=uYqSa6kkbjDZnpG8\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:19-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Making Garden Rows</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is discussing whether you need to make garden rows or not using the plow set. When the Plow Set attachment is hooked up to the Wheel Hoe will it create an elevated planting surface to plant seeds? Yes, it can make a garden row when they are positioned in the furrowing or hilling position. When it comes to planting on an elevated surface Travis mentions that it does not hurt anything in the garden, but it's an unnecessary step that we would have to take before planting. If you live in an area with poor soil drainage or a large amount of rainfall throughout the season by building a mound or hill and planting on top of it you're going to ensure the plants are higher up than the soil which will allow for better drainage and they will perform better. However, if you have a sandy loam soil that drains pretty well, so he doesn't need to make an elevated surface for planting. Instead of planting on an elevated surface, we like to plant on the flat soil and as some crops grow we will hill them to help with stabilizing the plant and encourage more root development.</p>\n<h2>Hoss Wheel Hoes</h2>\n<h3>Single Wheel Hoe</h3>\n<p>The first Wheel Hoe that was made available was the <a title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Wheel Hoe</a>, which was based on the old Planet Jr. Wheel Hoes that have been around for over 100 years. If you’re a beginner gardener and have a small garden that’s around 30×40 or 30×50 in size, the single is the perfect tool for you. It also comes with a set of three cultivator teeth that can be moved around the toolbar and up to five teeth can be used at once. With cool weather crops like lettuce, the Single Wheel Hoe allows for a narrower footprint when planting in the vegetable garden. However, another thing to keep in mind about this wheel hoe is not all of the attachments work on this tool.</p>\n<h3>Double Wheel Hoe</h3>\nThere are a couple of advantages when it comes to choosing the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> over the Single Wheel Hoe. The first advantage is you are able to straddle smaller plants between the two wheels. This works great for planting potatoes because you are able to straddle the seed potatoes and cover them up using the plow set attachment in the hilling position. Another big advantage of the double is every attachment that we carry at Hoss Tools works on this Wheel Hoe.\n<h3>High Arch Wheel Hoe</h3>\n<p>Similar in concept to the Double, the <a title=\"High Arch Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> allows you to straddle plants as well, but much taller plants like corn or potatoes. It also contains adjustable wheel spacing meaning the wheels can move in or out depending on your desired spacing in the garden. So basically you have three different settings on the wheel spacing which includes the innermost being 4 inches apart, the middle being 6 inches apart, and the farthest being 8 inches apart. Another difference is the High Arch has two toolbars instead of just one, which provides many more possibilities for planting within the garden.</p>\n<h2>Best Attachment for Furrowing</h2>\n<p>The <a title=\"Wheel Hoes\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\">Plow Set</a> attachment is the perfect tool to make furrows for planting or forming beds for hilling or throwing soil to plants to ensure plant stability and better root development in the vegetable garden. Easily attach the plow set individually or as a pair to the Single or Double Wheel Hoe. For example, you can easily place the plow set attachment in the inward position to make a perfect furrow for planting your potatoes and then turn the plows outward to easily cover the planted potatoes in the garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rw3cciamSkY?si=QqSDnOzUFbl192BS\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Time Frame of Gardening</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is discussing the needed time frame of growing vegetables in a garden. When keeping everything maintained, growing, and harvested it can all depend on the size of your vegetable garden and what crops are planted. Travis is going to give a personal example of how long it takes him to manage his garden area. He currently has four subplots that all total about 5,000 square feet plus an additional new garden area that has six subplots that will total up to 11,000 square feet of garden area. However, Travis does not always grow food in each of these plots he likes to use some subplots for cover cropping to help build the soil. The time frame that he prefers to use every day is at least 30 minutes a day out in the garden. It can vary from working or just walking around monitoring the plants to ensure there are no pests or diseases that need to be fixed. On the weekends, he likes to spend a little more time in the garden when weather permits to get the garden nice and cleaned for the upcoming week ahead. On average, Travis spends about 10 to 12 hours per week in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Maintaining Time in the Garden</h2>\n<p>Before growing or planting, it's important to determine how much time frame you will have each week to devote to the vegetable garden. You don't want to grow to large of a garden where it becomes overwhelming to deal with and you don't have enough time to work in maintaining the area. In order to break down the garden daily or weekly Travis is going to explain some percentages to help determine what activities take the most time when it comes to growing vegetables. The most common problem that people have when it comes to maintaining the garden is not having enough time to control weed germination. However, contrary to popular belief the time spent weeding in the garden is smaller percentage-wise compared to the time it takes to do other activities. This has a lot to do with having the right tools to control weeds quickly and effectively. Using tools such as the <a href=\"/products/single-tine-cultivator/\" title=\"Single Tine Cultivator\" target=\"_blank\">single tine cultivator</a>, <a href=\"/products/push-pull-hoe/\" title=\"Push Pull Hoe\" target=\"_blank\">push pull hoe</a>, and the <a href=\"/products/diamond-hoe/\" title=\"Diamond Hoe\" target=\"_blank\">diamond hoe</a> are all excellent in providing efficient weed control in the vegetable garden. Similar to weeding, spraying the area will take about the same amount of time as controlling the weeds. It takes Travis about 20 to 30 minutes to mix up an injector tank of <a href=\"/products/monterey-b-t/\" title=\"Monterey Bt\" target=\"_blank\">Monterey B.t.</a> or <a href=\"/products/neem-oil/\" title=\"Neem Oil\" target=\"_blank\">Neem Oil</a> and get it nicely coated on all the plants once a week in the garden. Once the temperatures increase and pest pressures get it higher then he will do it at least twice a week. Another task that doesn't take a lot of time in the garden is fertilizing. By streamlining the fertilizer using the <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">fertilizer inject</a><a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\" title=\"EZ Flo Fertilizer Injector\" target=\"_blank\">o</a><a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">r</a> it only takes about 10 minutes to set it up and flowing through the drip system. When side dressing with <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\" title=\"Chilean Nitrate Fertilizer\" target=\"_blank\">Chilean Nitrate</a> he prefers to add that on the same day he plans to weed or cultivate because it saves time by doing both tasks in one pass through along the rows. Using a drip irrigation system is another way to save an efficient amount of time in the garden as well. Not only does it save time, but it allows an accurate amount of irrigation to crops at the roots of the plants. The most amount of time spent in the garden comes when planting or harvesting vegetables. The time spent planting vegetables can vary based on transplants or direct seeding. As well as, what kind of crops you are harvesting in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDq80T6dV_Y?si=-dx8c_qf-ZS-hsOU\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:19-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Easiest Potatoes</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is demonstrating how to plant the easiest potatoes in the vegetable garden. In the South, the ideal potato planting time is around the middle to end of February. Typically, potatoes need to be planted anywhere from two to three weeks before the last frost date. Travis always likes to cut his seed potatoes because not only will they last longer, but they produce bigger potatoes in the garden. For example, if you plant a whole potato you'll more than likely get smaller potatoes, but if you cut them up and reduce the number of eyes planted in one spot you will get nice big potatoes instead. He also likes to cut the seed potato several days before planting because they need time for the open wound or the skin to heal over or suberize which helps prevent any fungal diseases and rot once we put them in the soil. Another important aspect of cutting seeds is the number of eyes you have per piece. Usually, the cut seeds only need around two to four eyes per piece to help ensure that there is not overcrowding in the area. The first step in planting the easiest potatoes is to mark off the rows in the desired subplot you want to plant them in. When planting potatoes his desired row spacing is three-foot apart to provide plenty of soil to hill the potatoes once they become larger. Using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and the <a title=\"Wheel Hoes\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\">plow set</a> attachment, Travis created a furrow where the rows were marked off for planting. Then, he laid the little seed potato pieces down in the furrow with around six to eight inches in spacing. Once all the seeds are planted he took his <a title=\"High Arch Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> and covered them all up along the row so they can start germinating in the vegetable garden. As they continue to grow you will need to hill the potatoes a couple of times throughout the growing season.</p>\n<h2>Potato Varieties</h2>\n<p>Of all the different potato varieties available, we offer some of the best productive varieties that all have excellent flavor profiles. The first variety is known as <a title=\"Adirondack Blue Potato\" href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Adirondack Blue</a> which contains a purple flesh potato that is rich in antioxidants. Usually taking around 85 days to mature this unique potato variety offers exceptional yields and excellent flavor. Another popular potato variety that provides the best flavor is the <a title=\"German Butterball Potato\" href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">German Butterball</a>. This variety is a late-season plant meaning it takes between 110 to 135 days to mature in the vegetable garden. The <a title=\"Red Norland Potato\" href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Norland</a> is a newer variety that has disease resistant to scab, late blight, and potato virus. This is another variety that has great yield, storage, and flavor profile. The <a title=\"Yukon Gold Potato\" href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukon Gold</a> is another popular variety that has been a favorite for gardeners for many years. All of these varieties work great for roasting, frying, baking, mashing, and so much more.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uU3V7YqgNUg?si=woN4QTSFFLIGQpNQ\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:18-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Creating the Dream Vegetable Garden</h2>\n<p>If you are a gardener there is no doubt that you have thought about what your dream vegetable garden would look like that you would love to have on your homestead. On this week's episode, Travis is explaining what his dream garden would like and how he plans to lay it out. Travis has had an area on his homestead that was around 12 rows of planted pines and he plans to change this area into a productive dream vegetable garden. The first step in this process was removing all the pines so he could pile them up and create a burn pile. Once the pine trees are cleaned up, he will take the tractor with a chisel plow and harrow to get the area leveled out, the grass chopped up, and the soil cultivated. This will allow the soil to more workable when it comes to planting in the Spring. The area he is working in is around 125 foot wide by 70 foot long and the first step to laying out the garden is to square off the rectangular spot. To make sure all the sides were even, he figured out what the hypotenuse or diagonal was and ran a string exactly that length to make sure he has right angles on all four sides of the area.</p>\n<h2>Designing and Layout</h2>\n<p>Once the area is laid off and squared it is time to divide it off into subplots to provide better crop rotation and manageability. When gardening the entire area in long rows it will end up being harder and you're restricted when it comes to rotating crops which is very important in having a successful productive garden. However, when incorporating subplots it allows you to work in one desired subplot each day and control the weeds a little bit better in the garden area. Travis took his area and divided it into six subplots that are all 30 by 35 in size which is almost square. He recommends square plots because for planting crops like corn it is better for pollination purposes. Another benefit of subplots is they offer you to plant individual families of vegetables in each plot and rotate those around so, in the long run, you avoid pest and disease problems. In between each subplot, there are walkways that are 10 feet wide to ensure Travis has plenty of room to move his mule around the garden when it comes time to harvest. When the subplots are all laid out, then he can start mapping out what he will plant in each of the individual plots. Travis prefers to map out the garden by sketching it out on a piece of paper in order to have a complete design plan laid out for reference. In this garden plot, he plans to plant potatoes, summer squash and cucumbers, peppers and eggplants, tomatoes, sweet corn, and winter squash in different subplots. Before planting all of these crops Travis plans to till the ground at least one or two more times to ensure he gets good workable soil before the growing season.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/79ZcOtUqNcE?si=WmqWqXspUEVf-85L\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:18-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Best Wheel Hoe</h2>\n<p>There are many different advantages to both the single and double wheel hoe. However, when it comes to what you need to do in the vegetable garden this will help determine which is the best wheel hoe for you. Each Hoss Wheel Hoe has a frame made of powder-coated steel, a 15-inch steel wheel and Amish-crafted, hardwood handles that are adjustable to accommodate your height. As well as, a thick steel tool bar that allows you to attach our various different <a title=\"Wheel Hoe Attachments\" href=\"/wheel-hoes?filter.v.price.gte=&amp;filter.v.price.lte=&amp;filter.p.tag=Attachments&amp;sort_by=manual\" target=\"_blank\">attachments</a> to perform all of your desired gardening tasks.</p>\n<h3>Single Wheel Hoe</h3>\n<p>One of the ultimate tools for growing food in your vegetable garden, the <a title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> can save you time and energy when doing various jobs in the soil. The best way to use this tool is for cultivating and weeding in your garden. When using the single wheel, you obtain a smaller footprint that allows you to operate in smaller row spacing which is ideal if you have a small garden area. Travis prefers to quickly and easily perform a shallow cultivation to control and prevent weeds from overtaking the area.</p>\n<h3>Double Wheel Hoe</h3>\n<p>The <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> comes with two wheels that provide better stability and enables you to straddle the row when plants are smaller, so you can weed both sides of the row in one pass through. This is an eco-friendly solution for cultivating and weeding in your vegetable garden that works in areas where a tractor or motorized tiller does not. If you plan to use the <a title=\"Drip Tape Layer Attachment\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\">Drip Tape Layer attachment</a> it can only be used with the Double Wheel Hoe.</p>\n<h2>Wheel Hoe Conversion Kit</h2>\n<p>However, we designed these two-wheel hoes to quickly and easily convert from a Single Wheel Hoe into a Double Wheel Hoe, using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe Conversion Kit\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe-conversion-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe Conversion Kit</a>. By simply switching the arms that extend out to the wheels and adding the longer axle the Single can easily be converted to the Double. Travis explains how to easily make this switch using the conversion kit. The first step to converting the Double is taking off both wheels and the dust caps using two half-inch wrenches. The two arms that extend out to the wheels are bowed out for the double but need to be switched around for the single. Using a socket to remove the arms he switches the arms around so that they are bowed in instead of out. He will place the wheel on the inside of the arms instead of two on the outside then install the shoulder bolt and dust caps. Once this is done the wheel should freely spin around but tight enough so the nuts do not come off. To convert from the single to the double you will need the conversion kit that includes a wheel, a longer axle, and two extra dust caps. To convert from the single to the double you will first remove the wheel and shoulder bolt. Then, switch the arms around so they are bowed out instead of in. Next, run the longer axle through the arms and add the dust caps and the two wheels on the outside of the arms.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wyKowjstSY?si=CVFzvvVvSKX_aArB\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:18-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Shallots in the Garden</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is planting shallots with the Hoss Wheel Hoe. Since shallots are Alliums, that means they are related to garlic and onions. Unlike onions, the shallots are planted in sets which is like an immature bulb that we plant and they will multiply out similar to bunching onions. Once they start multiplying they can make anywhere from 8 to 10 shallots in a bunch from each one of the little sets. The ideal planting space for shallot is 6 inches apart along the vegetable garden. After marking off where the rows are going to lay, Travis takes the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and creates a shallot planting furrow. When it comes to shallot planting, he took a pipe and cut it to the perfect length so he could easily drop his sets down the pipe to the desired planting spot while he was walking along the row. Similar to other crops, shallots are heavy feeders and require plenty of water and fertilizer. Shallots should be given at least 1 inch of water per week for best results in the garden. Travis recommends fertilizing with a complete fertilizer like our <a title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">20-20-20</a> initially to promote root development and then switching to nitrogen and sulfur-based fertilizer like our <a title=\"Ammonium Sulfate\" href=\"/products/ammonium-sulfate/\" target=\"_blank\">Ammonium Sulfate</a>. When it comes to harvesting shallots, they are ready when the majority of the tops begin to bend and collapse in the vegetable. You simply pull the shallots from the soil and allow them to “cure” in the sun for a couple of days. Once the shallots are cured they should be placed in a cool, dry area that is well-ventilated such as a basement or pole barn. Most shallots can be stored for up to five months in a proper storage area after harvesting.</p>\n<h2>Shallot Varieties</h2>\n<p>Travis has four different shallot varieties to try out in the garden. The first shallot variety is an elongated type known as Banana which is similar to our <a title=\"Roderique Shallot Set\" href=\"/products/roderique-shallot/\" target=\"_blank\">Roderique Shallot Set</a>. These shallots are usually two to three inches long at maturity and consist of copper skin with a crisp white flesh interior. Another elongated type shallot is the Monique Shallot which is a semi-long variety that has excellent disease-resistance and storage life. This shallot variety has rust-colored skin with light pink flesh and produces bulbs that can grow as large as three inches. The last shallot variety is a traditional round bulb that is known as Ambition. This is another variety that has excellent storage life and excellent flavor profiles.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQ68ryFHLRE?si=SQSmaNWthyXDIm6e\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Essential Tools for the Garden</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis goes over the most essential tools needed for growing a vegetable garden. When thinking about the various tools that we have available, Travis narrowed it down to the top five that he believes are necessary and essential to have a successful garden.</p>\n<h3>Garden Rake</h3>\n<p>The first essential tool to have is the <a title=\"Dura Rake Landscape Rake\" href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\" target=\"_blank\">garden rake</a> which is a popular tool to have in the vegetable garden. This rake is great for leveling out a smooth planting area prior to planting transplants or direct seeding. By using the steel tines on the rake head you can simply cultivate and aerate the garden soil. Bed preparation is important for ensuring you get the best results and the most abundant harvest from your vegetable garden. Not only are they great to use in the garden but also for various tasks around the homestead.</p>\n<h3>Garden Fork</h3>\n<p>Another essential tool to have around the homestead and inside the vegetable garden is the <a title=\"Garden Fork\" href=\"/products/garden-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Fork</a>. The heat-treated steel tines provide maximum strength for penetrating into the soil for gardens and raised beds. This is a must-have tool for growing potatoes because you can easily lift potatoes and sweet potatoes out of the soil for harvesting. An added bonus to this digging fork is the interchangeable rubber foot pad that provides a wide, firm surface for pushing the fork down into the soil with your dominant foot.</p>\n<h3>Compost Shovel</h3>\n<p>When dealing with any kind of loading and distributing compost into your garden for soil amending you will need a quality <a title=\"Compost Shovel\" href=\"/products/compost-shovel/\" target=\"_blank\">Compost Shovel</a> to get the job done. The shovel has a comfortable poly-D grip handle that won’t break or slip from your hands when in use. If you have compost on an even surface such as a concrete pad or sidewalk the aluminum blade shovel will work best. While the polymer blade shovel works great on uneven surfaces such as grass or dirt.</p>\n<h3>Batwing Garden Hoe</h3>\n<p>Based on the various garden hoes it's hard to pick just one but Travis suggests that the <a title=\"Long Batwing Hoe\" href=\"/products/long-batwing-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Long Batwing Hoe</a> is the most essential tool to have in the vegetable garden. Designed with a rounded and sharpened edge it is the ideal tool for removing large weeds or pulling dirt towards or away from plants. The shaft is hand-welded to the blade and the blade is hand-sharpened by a 4th generation blacksmith.</p>\n<h3>Single Wheel Hoe</h3>\n<p>As one of our most popular tools to have, the <a title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> is ideal for getting into narrow or tight row spacings in the vegetable garden. With the Wheel Hoe, you can quickly and easily perform shallow cultivation to control and prevent weeds from taking over the area. Each Hoss Wheel Hoe is created with a powder-coated steel frame, Amish crafted 15-inch steel wheel, and hardwood handles that are adjustable to accommodate your height.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH6dbhssjrQ?si=XipkDbx6ATvhlHVy\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "title": "Two Very Important Tips for Growing the Best Onions",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:17-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Two Important Tips</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis explains the important tips for growing the best onions in the garden. When it comes to growing the big softball sized onions there two very important tips to consider during this process. The first important key tip to consider is the time of planting in the garden. When it comes to planting onions, you need to plant them as soon as possible so you are able to get as much growth out of the plants during the growing season window. Onions have two growing stages such as the vegetative stage and the bulbing stage. During the vegetative phase, the key is to get as much leaf growth on the onion as you can because each leaf represents a ring on the onion bulb. Therefore, the more leaves you get the bigger the bulb you are going to get and the better bulbing stage that will occur. In the south, the ideal time to plant onions is in late November. The second important key tip to growing the best onions is proper feeding. Onions are heavy feeders they like plenty of water and fertilizer, therefore Travis recommends planting onions on <a title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">drip tape</a> to ensure they get equal amounts of both.</p>\n<h2>Growing the Best Onions</h2>\n<p>The two onion varieties that Travis is planting in the garden this season is Texas Legend and Red Creole. Before planting, he prepares the area by using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and the <a title=\"Drip Tape Layer Attachment\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\">drip tape layer</a> to lay the drip irrigation on two-foot row spacing. He prefers the two-foot row spacing because once the onions emerge this spacing will provide plenty of room to go in between the rows for cultivation and keeping the garden area clean. Travis also plants onions on double rows because he is able to get maximum production off one row of drip tape all while making the most out of spacing in the garden. Along the row, he spaces the onions about four inches apart and they will need some thinning if you want to get really big onions. Once the bulbs get about the size of a quarter, Travis will come in the garden and harvest every other onion along the row to use those as green onions. When it comes to feeding the onions, we can feed them using two different methods. The first way is to use the <a title=\"EZ Flo Fertilizer Injector\" href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\" target=\"_blank\">injector fertilizer</a> with <a title=\"20-20-20 Garden Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">20-20-20</a> through the drip irrigation system. When onions are young they require plenty of phosphorus and potassium to help encourage root development, but as they get older they simply just need nitrogen. As the onions continue to grow, he will switch to a primary nitrogen supplement such as <a title=\"Chilean Nitrate Fertilizer\" href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\">Chilean Nitrate</a> that can be injected through the drip tape or used as a side-dress along the rows. For side-dressing, we simply sprinkle it alongside the onion plants and then take the wheel hoe with the <a title=\"Cultivator Teeth\" href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\" target=\"_blank\">cultivator teeth</a> to incorporate it back into the soil. By supplying an accurate amount of irrigation and fertilizer we can ensure that the vegetative stage will get as much growth as possible to fulfill the bulbing stage.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9mvA21dAns?si=yX2s06QkVHWO9U8d\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>Row Maker</h2>\n<p>The handy and effective tool that Travis will be using to create the garden rows is the <a title=\"Row Maker\" href=\"/products/row-maker/\" target=\"_blank\">Row Maker</a>. This tool will allow you to make multiple planting furrows in the garden by simply dragging it along the soil. It contains a nice 54-inch hardwood handle that attaches to the frame with U-bolts that are provided. The powder-coated steel frame is three-foot-long with six holes for arranging the spades in a number of row spacing combinations. Along the frame, the spades can easily be adjusted by loosening and removing a small wing nut. The row maker comes with four spades, but we have additional spades if you would like to add more.</p>\n<h2>Making the Best Garden Rows</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is demonstrating how to create the easiest garden rows for planting in the garden. Travis is going to use the row maker to plant some beets along the edge of the garden. The area he plans to plant beets in is around five foot wide and usually used for intensive planting. For planting beets, he is going to use the row maker with 4 spades equally spaced a foot apart. Before planting, he prepares the area using the <a title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> and the <a title=\"Cultivator Teeth\" href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\" target=\"_blank\">cultivator teeth</a> attachment to break up the soil before running the row maker along the soil. Next, Travis takes the row maker and simply walks backwards dragging it along the soil to make four evenly-spaced planting furrows. You can either direct seed or transplant in the furrows, but Travis likes to transplant beets because it is easier to thin in the trays versus doing it in the ground later when they start emerging. Also, the beets tend to grow out a little better when germinating in the <a title=\"Seed Starting Trays\" href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\" target=\"_blank\">seed starting trays</a> because they tend to be in a controlled greenhouse area and don't experience severe pest and disease pressures. Travis is planting the <a title=\"Touchstone Gold Beet\" href=\"/products/touchstone-gold-beet/\" target=\"_blank\">Touchstone Gold</a> variety which makes an orange-goldish beet that contains excellent flavor profiles and consistently round when spaced properly in the garden. He is also planting the <a title=\"Merlin Beet\" href=\"/products/merlin-beet/\" target=\"_blank\">Merlin</a> variety which is a red beet that has a high sugar content that makes it sweeter than any other beet variety. When planting the beet transplants, he places them about four to six inches apart along the furrow to ensure there is plenty of spacing in the garden. Overall, the best garden rows are made using the row maker because it is the simplest tool to quickly and effectively make straight rows in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ci5C1b7gwf4?si=OYLg39MNo1NqG5mH\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "title": "The Best Guide to Planting Carrots in the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:15-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Guide to Planting Carrots</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is explaining how to grow maximum yields of carrots in the vegetable garden. For about three years, Travis has tried a particular technique when growing carrots that has done extremely well. The guide to planting carrots is finding the perfect time to plant them in the garden. When it comes to germinating carrots they prefer soil temperatures to be around 75 to 80 degrees which means carrots cannot be grown during the hotter months. Travis suggests planting carrots in the fall towards the end of October when temperatures are cooler which lets us overwinter and harvest them in the spring. Also, we can succession plant carrots in the spring around February to harvest before the warm weather comes towards May. Unlike other crops, carrots take a long time to germinate, so if you experience heavy weed pressures that can be a major problem when growing carrots. When it comes to heavy weeds in the garden this creates major issues because weeds will compete with carrots for nutrients in the soil. To help prepare the garden for planting, Travis likes to take his <a title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> to cultivate the area about twice a week for a month to ensure he maintains a stale weed seed bed. Another way to reduce heavy weed pressures is by using a <a title=\"Silage Tarp 30x40\" href=\"/products/silage-tarp-30-x-40/\" target=\"_blank\">Silage Tarp</a> to kill off weeds before planting carrots in the soil. This year, Travis's area for planting carrots is 15 foot wide by 40 foot long and he plans on planting in double rows to ensure he gets maximum yield. When adding double rows he spaces them three foot apart and places stakes to mark off each row in the garden so he can create straight rows using the wheel hoe. The first guide to planting carrots is using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a title=\"Wheel Hoes\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\">plow set</a> attachment to help create furrows along the row where the drip tape will be laid in the area. Travis recommends using <a title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">drip tape</a> to ensure the carrots get an adequate amount of irrigation and fertilizer directly to the plant roots where they need it most. Before adding drip tape, Travis likes to add a good quality compost down to help supply nutrients in the soil before planting. To incorporate the drip he runs the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">drip tape layer attachment</a> along the furrows so he can bury the drip tape and cover it in one pass through. When using a mechanical <a title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\" target=\"_blank\">garden seeder</a> you must use pelleted carrot seeds so it will feed through the seeder properly. However, you can also use raw carrot seeds for planting by hand as well. Once the carrot seeds are planted, Travis is going to take a rake and lightly cover them along the row in the garden.</p>\n<h2>Carrot Varieties</h2>\n<p>The three varieties of carrots Travis is planting this year is the Bolero, Yellowstone, and Purple Haze. The <a title=\"Bolero Carrot\" href=\"/products/bolero-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Bolero Carrot</a> variety is an exceptional hybrid that is not only disease-resistant but has a great flavor profile. While the <a title=\"Yellowstone Carrot\" href=\"/products/yellowstone-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Yellowstone</a> is an open-pollinated variety that produces large yellow carrots with vigorous tops. The last variety he is going to plant this year is the <a title=\"Purple Haze Carrot\" href=\"/products/purple-haze-carrot/\" target=\"_blank\">Purple Haze</a> which is visually appealing with a dark purple exterior and orange interior in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdqYMoKIEE4?si=gMSIk2FWkbgJ4GaR\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:15-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Growing Sweet Potatoes</h2>\n<p>The most beneficial benefit when growing sweet potatoes is the variety of vitamins and minerals the crop provides. Another benefit of growing sweet potatoes in the garden is the ability to produce a maximum yield of crops that will ultimately store for a long period of time on the homestead. Also, after harvested they can be cooked and used in various recipes. When growing sweet potatoes, not only are they easy to grow, but they bring different and unique varieties to the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Planting the Biggest Sweet Potato</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is harvesting some of the biggest sweet potatoes in the garden this year. When it comes to planting sweet potatoes, we aren’t planting the actual potato we are planting what is known as slips. When you leave the sweet potato out long enough it will begin to grow shoots off of it kind of like a regular potato with buds. With the sweet potato slips, you simply pluck them off the potato, place the potato slips in the water, and they start to develop roots when placed in the vegetable garden. Travis planted his sweet potatoes around the middle of June after the spring crops were done because it just works the best with his crop rotation in the garden. However, you can also plant sweet potatoes as soon as the temperatures start to warm up in the spring and harvest them in the late summer as well. At the end of October, Travis is digging up four rows that are 40 inches long of sweet potatoes. Using the <a title=\"Large Shallow Tubtrug\" href=\"/products/large-shallow-tubtrug/\" target=\"_blank\">Large Shallow Tubtrug</a> for harvesting he has dug up around 80 pounds for sweet potatoes along each garden row. Over the years, Travis has a few tips and tricks for growing the biggest sweet potato varieties. Unlike other crops, sweet potatoes do not really like to be spoon-fed with a lot of fertilizer or water making them maintenance-free in that aspect. Travis recommends hilling the sweet potatoes because not only does it make them easier to harvest but it helps eliminate weed pressures throughout the growing season. This year Travis tried a new trick for growing better sweet potatoes which included pruning back or cutting the trailing vines that grow along the middle of the rows. Around every two or three weeks, he uses his tiller to run through the rows to chop all the vines so the crops can focus all their energy back into growing the biggest sweet potato. By tilling the vines along the rows it allows for easier harvest and better production of sweet potatoes overall.</p>\n<h2>Harvesting Sweet Potatoes</h2>\n<p>When harvesting sweet potatoes, we recommend using our <a title=\"Garden Fork\" href=\"/products/garden-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">garden fork</a> to easily lift and dig sweet potatoes out of the vegetable garden. Once all the sweet potatoes are harvested it takes several weeks for them to cure before they are ready to be used in the kitchen. To start the curing process, Travis begins by placing them underneath an area that is well covered, cool, dry, and aerated area. He has a storage rack that allows for the sweet potatoes to be spread out over netted shelves instead of on the ground. When the sweet potatoes are done with the curing process, then they can be kept in storage for sometimes as long as six months.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/olvcx3Uz9TQ?si=Y6VLNtQdYRjLlRUH\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:14-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What are Muscadines?</h2>\n<p>A staple crop of the South, muscadines can be used for a variety of ways such as fresh off the vine or used in the kitchen to make jelly, cobblers, and wine. The muscadines do best in warmer climates where temperatures don't get below 10 degrees. Therefore they do best in the south and not as good in the northern climates. There are several different muscadine varieties, but Travis is not sure which varieties he currently has growing on his vines. However, the four different types are a larger purple muscadine, smaller purple muscadine, smaller bronze muscadine, and a larger bronze muscadine. Another benefit of growing muscadines is they are rich in antioxidants making them a very healthy crop from the vegetable garden. However, when eating muscadines fresh off the vine you should definitely avoid eating the seeds inside the muscadine.</p>\n<h2>Making Muscadine Wine</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is making muscadine wine straight from the vine. As far as taking care of muscadines they are pretty much maintenance-free once they are established on the homestead. The only maintenance we recommend is during the wintertime the need to be pruned back. Usually, around January, Travis will take his <a title=\"Pruning Shears\" href=\"/products/pruning-shears/\" target=\"_blank\">pruning shears</a> to prune back the vines real close so they can grow back out and produce more muscadines. Also, he does not add irrigation or fertilizer to the plants just prunes them back for maintenance. On Travis's particular vine it is around a 100 foot long and the purple muscadine type produces the quickest over the bronze muscadines every year. After harvesting, he received around 12 to 15 gallons of the purple muscadines and normally the same amount for the bronze when they finish maturing. To make muscadine wine he starts by placing them in a grape crusher to crush them all down. Then, once they are crushed we can place them in a juicer that has a bladder in the middle that fills up with water and squeezes them against the sides to release all the juices out. By releasing all the juice in the juicer we are able to extract all the juice for the muscadine wine making process.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWatexmYOQQ?si=htGksDxufinh_DTE\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "title": "Growing Irish Potatoes in the Fall Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:14-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Irish Potatoes</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is trying to grow Irish potatoes in the Fall vegetable garden. The variety of potatoes Travis is planting today is <a title=\"Yukon Gold Potato\" href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukon Gold</a>. Since seed potato producers do not usually have any potatoes available towards the end of August. Since that is the case, he had to buy the potatoes a couple of months ago and let them sit in the fridge until it was time to plant them in the South. We place them in the fridge to help stunt the growth until planting since some of the potatoes already have a few buds on them. When you are ready to plant them you simply take them out of the fridge, cut them up, and start planting. The two main reasons we like to cut our potatoes instead of planting them whole is to get more and produce bigger potatoes. By cutting the potatoes up, Travis is able to make them go further and get more potatoes to grow in the vegetable garden. If you look on the seed potatoes, the eyes or buds are where the potato is starting to sprout and the more of those that are planted in a specific spot the more potatoes you are going to produce. However, with too many eyes in one spot, you will end up planting smaller potatoes in the garden. Also, once you cut the potatoes the skin needs time to heal before planting in the vegetable garden. This ensures that the potato pieces do not become susceptible to soil fungus and rot in the garden.</p>\n<h2>Planting Potatoes</h2>\n<p>When it comes to preparing the garden for planting Irish potatoes, Travis has tried many different row spacings but has found that three-foot is about as narrow as you can go in between the potato rows. The first step in preparing for planting is to mark off the rows and make a furrow using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> to plant the potatoes in the garden. Then, he takes the cut up seed potatoes and places them along the furrow with around 8 inches apart. After he has laid all of the potatoes along the furrow it is time to cover them up and make a little hill on top of those potatoes. To cover them up and make a hill we highly recommend using the <a title=\"High Arch Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a title=\"Wheel Hoes\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\">plow set</a> attachment in the hilling position. However, if you do not have a high arch available to use, you can also use the double wheel hoe for both the furrowing and hilling portion of planting the potatoes. When it comes to irrigation, Travis has had issues in the past with planting them on drip tape therefore Irish potatoes are one crop that he does not put drip irrigation on.</p>\n<h2>Different Potato Varieties</h2>\n<p>The first variety is known as <a title=\"Adirondack Blue Potato\" href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Adirondack Blue</a> which contains a purple flesh potato that is rich in antioxidants. Usually taking around 85 days to mature this unique potato variety offers exceptional yields and excellent flavor. Another popular potato variety that provides the best flavor is the <a title=\"German Butterball Potato\" href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">German Butterball</a>. This variety is a late-season plant meaning it takes between 110 to 135 days to mature in the vegetable garden. The <a title=\"Red Norland Potato\" href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Norland</a> is a newer variety that has disease resistant to scab, late blight, and potato virus. This is another variety that has great yield, storage, and flavor profile. The <a title=\"Yukon Gold Potato\" href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukon Gold</a> is another popular variety that has been a favorite for gardeners for many years.

The thornless blackberry varieties provide exceptional flavor profiles, large blackberries, and much easier to harvest due to no thorns on the plants. Another benefit of having blackberries around the homestead is the many different health benefits they can provide.</p>\n<h2>Maintenance on Thornless Blackberry Beds</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is demonstrating how to maintain yearly maintenance on thornless blackberry beds. About a month ago, the thornless blackberries stopped producing and so now it is time to clean the bed area. Travis is not quite sure what thornless variety of blackberries he currently has, but it does produce heavy yields and requires a little bit more maintenance. The first step Travis is going to do is trim them back to about knee-high because they will grow fast in the garden bed. Next, when it comes to pruning blackberries you do not have to be as particular as you would pruning a fruit tree. However, Travis suggests cutting them at the lateral limb just below that limb to ensure he provides some room for growth to help it continue photosynthesizing. You can also trellis the thornless blackberries but you still have to trim them back every year. Since Travis has small beds, instead of trellising he just prefers to prune them back which works just fine. The second step is to add mulch such as wheat straw around the plants and rake it in. He is going to lay a thick layer of the wheat straw to provide a nice structure and keep it maintained inside the thornless blackberry beds. After the wheat straw is laid all we have to do is water the plants in the bed. We don't have to worry about controlling weeds due to the wheat straw in the bed that helps control it for us. Overall, the thornless blackberry beds are pretty much maintenance-free with the exception of coming in the bed to add a new layer of wheat straw about once a year. Then, when it is time for harvesting blackberries the best time is in early spring when they start producing.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmeVdCUTWl4?si=Q-1IfDYjjJcBaSsT\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "body_html": "<h2>High Arch Wheel Hoe</h2>\n<p>Similar in design to the Double, the <a title=\"High Arch Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> allows you to straddle plants as well, but much taller plants like corn, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. It also contains adjustable wheel spacing meaning the wheels can move in or out depending on your desired spacing in the garden. So basically you have three different settings on the wheel spacing which includes the innermost being 4 inches apart, the middle being 6 inches apart, and the farthest being 8 inches apart. Another difference is the High Arch has two toolbars instead of just one, which provides many more possibilities for planting within the garden. When it comes time to hill sweet potatoes we use the High Arch over any other wheel hoe because of its ability to adjust the spacing on the row of plants that are in the garden.</p>\n<h2>Hill Sweet Potatoes</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is explaining the best way to hill sweet potatoes using the High Arch Wheel Hoe in the vegetable garden. To hill sweet potatoes you don't necessarily have to, but Travis likes to for a couple of different reasons such as weed control, production, and ease of digging along the rows. For reducing weeds growing along the sweet potato rows, Travis has been using the <a title=\"Single Tine Cultivator\" href=\"/products/single-tine-cultivator/\" target=\"_blank\">single tine cultivator</a> to help control the weed germination until the plants have grown a little bit bigger. Once, the plants have become established we can go in with the High Arch to hill the sweet potatoes and smother out the weeds in the middle. Since sweet potato plants grow in vines along the ground which in return produces runners that spread throughout the entire garden plot. The vines or runners will set roots in the ground and start to produce even more sweet potatoes in the vegetable garden. In other words, Travis is going to concentrate on those vines or runners in one spot and cover them up by hilling it will increase our overall production of sweet potatoes. As a warm-weather crop, when it comes time to dig sweet potatoes it can become tough because the summer sun is baking the ground and make the garden soil hard to work in. To avoid digging in the hard ground, Travis likes to go in between the rows using the <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a title=\"Sweeps Attachment\" href=\"/products/sweeps\" target=\"_blank\">sweeps attachment</a> to break up the soil and have some available soil to use during the hilling process. Using the High Arch, Travis is going to use the widest setting in order to throw up a wider hill to the sweet potatoes. If you happen to run over a couple of the plants, it will be fine because sweet potato plants are really resilient and the vines will grow back quick. As the sweet potato plants continue to grow, Travis will continue to hill the plants to maintain the garden. Then, towards the last hill, before harvesting, he will probably have to use a <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dura Rake Landscape Rake\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">garden rack</a> to hill the plants and get a nice mound towards the end of the growing season.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn6WA72hfFw?si=5LW5Ec1x3I1KV5R6\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:13-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What is Spaghetti Squash?</h2>\n<p>Spaghetti squash is a winter squash variety that is known as a personal-sized squash because they are about half the size of a normal-sized squash. The <a title=\"Small Wonder Spaghetti Squash\" href=\"/products/small-wonder-spaghetti-squash\" target=\"_blank\">Small Wonder Spaghetti Squash</a> is a very productive hybrid variety that produces higher yields than any other spaghetti squash varieties. This spaghetti squash variety has a vining growth habit that produces 10-15 bright yellow fruits per plant. The best way to cook with this variety is to use it as an alternative to pasta and prepare it by cutting in half, bake or microwave, and tease with a fork to reveal the delicious strands. Then, you can simply enjoy the taste of this wonderful spaghetti squash.</p>\n<h2>Planting Spaghetti Squash</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is preparing a bumper crop of spaghetti squash in the vegetable garden. When planting spaghetti squash we recommend direct seeding every 12 inches along the garden row. Once plants emerge, thin plants to one every 2 feet. Since winter squash can be susceptible to plant diseases like downy mildew and powdery mildew if leaves receive excess moisture. We suggest using <a title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">drip irrigation</a> on winter squash to reduce plant moisture and feed plants more effectively throughout the growing season. Also, during periods of heavy rainfall, using a fungicide like <a title=\"Liquid Copper Fungicide\" href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Copper</a> will help alleviate disease pressure as well. Since spaghetti squash is classified as a winter squash it is a crop that will produce a one-time harvest at the end of the growing season. You will know when to harvest squash because the plants will die back and the fruits have obtained their full color in the garden. Also, when stems become hard this an indication of fruit maturity and fruits can be harvested using <a title=\"Pruning Shears\" href=\"/products/pruning-shears/\" target=\"_blank\">pruning shears</a>. Once all of the winter squash is harvested it can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months, depending on variety and sugar content. Usually, we can store winter squash for up to 6 months in proper storage conditions. It is also very important to remove the plants from the garden to prevent any fungal spores from overwintering and becoming a problem in future growing seasons. By implementing a proper crop rotation in the garden this will also help eliminate pest and disease pressures in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Popular Winter Squash Varieties</h2>\n<p>The <a title=\"Hai Kabocha Squash\" href=\"/products/hai-kabocha-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Hai Kabocha</a> is one of the tastiest winter squashes to grow and produces dark green fruits with gray speckling and a bright yellow flesh interior squash. The hybrid, <a title=\"Hoss Butternut Squash\" href=\"/products/hoss-butternut-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Hoss Butternut Squash</a> is a productive variety that produces large uniform fruits in the garden. This is another variety that has excellent flavor and texture. Another variety is the <a title=\"Delicata Winter Squash\" href=\"/products/delicata-winter-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Delicata Winter Squash</a> that contains a higher sugar content and sweeter flavor than other squash varieties. This variety produces fruits with a creamy-white color with green specks and stripes. Two new winter squash varieties we have available is Sweet Dumpling and Table Ace Acorn. The open-pollinated, <a title=\"Sweet Dumpling Squash\" href=\"/products/sweet-dumpling-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Sweet Dumpling Squash</a> variety is a delicata-squash type that has a sweet flavor profile and produces personal-sized fruits. With a look similar to pumpkins, the sweet dumpling has an ivory coloration with dark green stripes and light yellow flesh interior. The <a title=\"Table Ace Acorn Squash\" href=\"/products/table-ace-acorn-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Table Ace Acorn Squash</a> is known as the best tasting acorn squash on the market. This is a hybrid variety that produces maximum fruits in a little amount of space allowing you to save space in the smallest gardens.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XjL0Zsu50Q?si=ti2PE2W-YYwdbLKZ\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:13-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Succession Planting</h2>\n<p>Succession planting is known as staggering multiple crops in the same area throughout the growing season to ultimately get a continuous harvest. We suggest succession planting squash, okra, cucumbers, and other vegetables to increase the maximum yield of crops for a longer period of time within the vegetable garden. Some additional benefits of succession planting are pests, weed and fertility control in the area. By succession planting, you can allow the garden space to germinate weed seeds in between plantings of crops. Then, lightly cultivate to eliminate the weed seeds before succession planting the next round of crops. For pest and disease control, succession planting allows you to determine what pest or disease problems you might have and where certain crops do well in a specific location in the garden. When it comes to fertility control, by succession planting you can determine which crops need more amending or fertilizer in the soil to improve plant growth throughout the season.</p>\n<h2>Succession Planting Squash &amp; Okra</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis explains how you can increase yield by succession planting in the vegetable garden. When it comes to succession planting squash, Travis is able to get up to 4 plantings in the area from early spring on into summer. When succession planting okra, he is able to do 3 successions per year. To prepare the garden for succession planting, Travis likes to use the fad system which stands for furrow, amend, and drip. First, he uses his <a title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> to make a furrow in the ground where our compost and drip tape will be laid. Next, we will add a little layer of good compost to the furrow to help improve the organic matter in the soil. Then, Travis will use the <a title=\"Drip Tape Layer Attachment\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\">Drip Tape Layer attachment</a> to lay the <a title=\"Drip Tape Irrigation Kit\" href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">drip tape</a> and cover it up all in one passing. To plant squash and okra, he will allow the drip tape emitters to fill up with water and place seeds along the water spots of the emitters on top of the soil. When succession planting squash he will direct seed the <a title=\"Sunburst Squash\" href=\"/products/sunburst-squash/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunburst Squash</a>. While he uses the garden seeder to succession plant the <a title=\"Jambalaya Okra\" href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Jambalaya Okra</a>.</p>\n<h2>Planting Squash &amp; Okra</h2>\n<p>When planting squash we recommend direct seeding seeds every 12 inches along the garden row. Squash is a crop that requires multiple harvests throughout the growing season and should be harvested every 2 or 3 days to ensure no fruits become too large and unpalatable in the garden. Travis recommends transplanting okra in the early spring to get a jumpstart on production and early germination of plants during the growing season. By transplanting in our <a title=\"Seed Starting Trays\" href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\" target=\"_blank\">seed starting trays</a> this ensures a solid root ball because of the internal root training ribs that help the plants grow properly and reduce transplant shock when placed in the vegetable garden. When it comes to succession planting squash and okra we recommend maintaining your garden in between each planting to provide better plant growth, maximize space, and improve harvesting yields.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c55o5Wcn_q4?si=FTIEyCvpIphgIcYH\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:12-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Sweet Corn</h2>\nThe best time to plant sweet corn is during the spring after the last frost date has happened. When it comes to planting sweet corn or any kind of corn variety it should be planted in blocks or squares for better pollination. Planting in blocks instead of long rows ensures that once the crop starts tasselling the wind can effectively pollinate the corn. Corn is a self-pollinating plant that produces a male flower, which is commonly referred to as a tassel, and a female flower, which is commonly referred to as the silks. In order for kernels of corn to be produced by the plant, the male flowers must pollinate the female flowers. The male flower is located at the very top of the plant whereas the female flower is formed along the stalk of the plant. The male flower contains the pollen, which is primarily spread by wind, that will be used to pollinate the female plant in the garden. Another major factor of planting sweet corn is it needs plenty of <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> to grow throughout the season. Since corn is a heavy feeder it needs plenty of water and fertilizer to get healthy producing plants during the warmer months.\n<h2>Removing Silks</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is demonstrating the easiest way to remove silks from sweet corn. This year, Travis planted <a href=\"/products/ambrosia-sweet-corn/\">Ambrosia Sweet Corn</a> that is a hybrid, sugary-enhanced variety with excellent flavor profiles. When sweet corn is ready to harvest from the garden Travis explains that the corn silks become brown. After harvesting all the sweet corn, then he uses the <a href=\"/products/corn-silking-brush/\">corn silking brush</a> to easily remove the silks from the corn cobs. The brush has extra-soft bristles that allow you to brush the cobs without damaging or puncturing the kernels. This brush works great on many different field corn and sweet corn varieties.\n<h2>Different Sweet Corn Varieties</h2>\nThe <a href=\"/products/silver-queen-sweet-corn/\">Silver Queen</a> has been a popular older corn variety that has been grown in the garden for several years. It usually grows 8 to 9 inches tall and produces ears that are 8 to 9 inches long. An All-American Selections winner, the <a href=\"/products/honey-select-sweet-corn/\">Honey Select Sweet Corn</a> variety is a sugary enhanced hybrid that has an excellent flavor profile. While the sugary enhanced <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\">Peaches and Cream</a> variety contains bicolor ears that are white and yellow kernels that perform best when creamed and frozen for later use on the homestead. Another variety that is our personal favorite is the <a href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\">Incredible Sweet Corn</a> which contains an excellent disease resistance package. Lastly, the <a href=\"/products/stowells-evergreen-sweet-corn/\">Stowell’s Evergreen</a> is an heirloom, open-pollinated variety that produces consistent white kernels that have a great flavor profile and stores well after harvesting from the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ob_V5tULPY&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=54&amp;t=98s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Best Potato Varieties</h2>\nThe most popular variety of potatoes is the <a href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\">Yukon Gold</a> which is a versatile potato variety that produces heavy yields, has an excellent flavor profile, and makes consistent medium to large-sized potatoes. Similar to the Yukon Gold the <a href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\">German Butterball</a> produces medium to large-sized potatoes. This variety contains a buttery-yellow flesh with an excellent flavor profile and longer storage life. While the <a href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\">Adirondack Blue</a> is a purple-fleshed potato that is rich in antioxidants and provides maximum yields. It has a unique color that remains the same when cooked and has great flavoring profiles too. Finally, the <a href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\">Red Norland</a> is known for having exceptional storage and is great for boiling or roasting. It also has better disease resistance to scab, potato virus, and Rhizoctonia, unlike other potato varieties.\n<h2>Harvesting Potatoes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is explaining the best ways to harvest and store potatoes from the vegetable garden. Recently, here in the South, we have received rain just about every day or at least two to three times a day. Due to all the rain, Greg can't spray anything and the weeds have pretty much taken over the garden which has caused a major issue. He has even experienced the best crop of potatoes that he has ever grown, but hasn't been able to harvest them. So for the first time ever, he is going to dig wet potatoes from the garden. Since he is digging up the potatoes while it is still rather wet it is important that he lets the potatoes air-dry underneath the barn before storing them. Our favorite tools to use when it comes to harvesting potatoes is the <a href=\"/products/garden-fork/\">Garden Fork</a> and <a href=\"/products/tubtrug-bundle-4-pack/\">TubTrug containers</a>. A garden fork is a handy tool that is great for digging potatoes or cultivating the soil. We recommend using the Tubtrugs because they are great for harvesting multiple vegetables and for a variety of uses on the homestead as well.\n<h2>Storing Potatoes</h2>\nWhen storing potatoes the best way is to place them on a storage rank underneath a barn that is dry and has plenty of aeration. While placing them on the storage rack, Greg suggests inspecting all the potatoes for soft spots, mold, and pest damage. Similar to several other crops that are harvested from the garden, we do not wash the potatoes until we are ready to use them which allows for longer storage life. The storage life of potatoes is typically around 2 to 3 months with proper storage conditions.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er7sF7vyruI&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=55&amp;t=0s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Why Plant Sweet Onions?</h2>\nAccording to Travis, planting onions are one of the most valuable crops in the vegetable garden. They generally don't take up a lot of room and the storage life is great for multiple months. Another benefit of growing sweet onions is they provide plenty of beneficial vitamins and minerals. When using sweet onions in the kitchen there are a variety of ways that it can be cooked and used in recipes on the homestead.\n<h2>Harvesting Sweet Onions</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is discussing ways to harvest and store sweet onions from the vegetable garden. When growing sweet onions the best time to plant is November through December in warmer climates. You will know when to harvest sweet onions because the necks will get soft and start to fall over in the garden. Travis recently harvested his Texas Legend and Red Creole onions from Dixondale Farms that he planted in November. Since onions are heavy feeders which means they need plenty of water or fertilizer we like to plant our onions on double rows with <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> running through the middle. When planting double rows, Travis will plant on either side of the tape which allows for saving space in the garden and maximizing yield. When growing onions, Travis mentions that depending on the amount of water added to them throughout the growing season the sweeter they will become. Once Travis has pulled all of the sweet onions, he likes to lay them on the ground beside the garden to ensure they get plenty of sun for curing or drying out for a few days before storing them underneath the barn. However, during the onion curing process, it is important to keep an eye on the weather because rain can be an issue.\n<h2>Storing Sweet Onions</h2>\nIn the South, most people don't have storage cellars or basements to store vegetables. However, most people with homesteads do have old open-air barns with a dirt floor that is used when storing sweet onions, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and winter squash. Travis recently built a storage rack for keeping vegetables up off the ground and to keep them drier underneath the barn. The storage rack was made with 4x4's on the end while in the middle it's about 6 inches tall and 10 inches long. He also has 4 different racks that are all 1.5 inches apart which allows him room to stick his head in the comfortably while sorting through the vegetables. For the shelves, Travis used 1/2 inch squared hardware cloth and simply stapled that to each of the shelves. When Travis goes to store his sweet onions, he prefers to lay them out instead of stacking them on top of one another and leaves the tops on them because it keeps the onions from rolling around on the hardware cloth. Typically underneath the barn on this storage rack, the sweet onions can store for up to 6 six months or even longer.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFFREIxF5AM&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=56&amp;t=178s",

    "title": "Reducing Your Weed Seed Bank in the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:09-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What is a Weed Seed Bank?</h2>\nThe weed seed bank is the amount of weed seeds you have stored in your garden soils. However, we want to eliminate the weed seeds in the soil because they can cause some serious issues in the garden. The contributions that we can't control when it comes to weed seeds are wind, water, and animals such as birds. In other words, we can't control the wind blowing around seeds from outside the garden into the garden, weed seeds getting added to the garden by water runoff caused by rainfall, and birds that eat plants then come into our garden adding the weed seeds to the area. However, the one thing we can control is maintaining the weeds that are growing in the garden to eliminate them from developing more seeds.\n<h2>4 Simple Solutions</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about reducing your weed seed bank in the vegetable garden soils. Once you start seeing weeds pop up in your garden that is the best time to start removing them so they do not overpopulate your garden. If you have a new garden area the weed seed bank will be much higher than a garden that has been growing vegetables for a couple of years. Over the years of growing vegetables in a garden and removing weeds properly from the area, your weed seed bank will lower the amount of pressure every year. The first solution to keeping the weed seeds eliminated is through frequent shallow cultivation. In order to do this, we suggest using the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> which allows you to cultivate the top layer of the soil enough to disturb the small weeds from continuing to grow and keep the new weeds from germinating. We also recommend using the wheel hoe at least once a week or every time it rains so your garden does not crust over and it is easier to cultivate in the following weeks. Travis also alternates between two different wheel hoe attachments such as the <a href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\">cultivator teeth</a> and <a href=\"/products/winged-sweeps/\">winged sweeps</a> to ensure he gets the best cultivation in the garden. The cultivator teeth will help lift the small weeds to the top of the soil so ultimately the sun will be able to bake them and kill them. The winged sweeps will do a good job of cutting through any of the weed roots underneath the soil layer. However, if you harder clay-like soils instead of using the sweeps the <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\">oscillating hoe</a> will be a better attachment to use in those soil types. The second solution is to reduce the amount of overhead watering going on in the vegetable garden. If you use <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">drip tape</a> you are able to provide an accurate amount of irrigation directly to the plants and avoid watering unnecessary spots that can cause weed germination. Another solution is to keep the grass cut around the garden. Keeping the grass cut eliminates a weed seed reservoir on the outside of the garden where wind, birds, and water can move weed seeds into the garden. The last simple solution that Travis mentions is to avoid letting your garden get away from you when you aren't using it. There are a few ways to avoid letting this happen such as grow plants year-around, grow cover crops, or use a silage tarp to prevent weed germination. By establishing these practices in the garden you should be able to remove the weed seed bank and overall have a better vegetable garden throughout every growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrIF0KtHRcM&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=57&amp;t=28s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:09-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Trellising Tomatoes</h2>\nWhen it comes to trellising tomato plants there are many advantages that improve the overall health of these plants. The easiest Florida weave trellis technique is used for determinate tomatoes, while tomato cages are typically used for indeterminate tomatoes in the vegetable garden. We use the tomato cages for indeterminate tomatoes because they have continuous growth and will grow a lot taller than determinate tomatoes. We use the Flordia weave technique for determinate tomatoes because they tend to grow smaller and have earlier harvesting times in the vegetable garden. The advantages of trellising tomato plants include more exposure to sunlight, improve the quality of foliage, and reduce disease pressures. With better exposure to sunlight, the tomato plants will continue to grow and increase productivity. Another benefit of adding the trellis technique is it makes pruning, fertilizing, and harvesting easier when it comes time. Also, the plants are growing vertically so there is a decrease in soil-borne disease pressures due to the plants not growing on the ground in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Florida Weave Technique</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is going over the easiest way to trellis tomatoes using the Florida weave technique. He currently has both indeterminate and determinate tomatoes growing in the garden. For his indeterminate tomatoes like the <a href=\"/products/brandywine-pink-tomato/\">Brandywine</a> variety, Travis is using his <a href=\"/products/tomato-cages/\">tomato cages</a> to help support the growing plants. Now it is time to run the Flordia weave technique on the determinate tomatoes like the <a href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\">Bella Rosa</a> and <a href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\">Brickyard</a> varieties. To begin setting up the Florida weave, you will need t-posts, wooden stakes, and <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">Gro-Tie Garden Twine</a>. Travis prefers to use T-posts and squared wooden stakes because they tend to work better than the stakes that are round because do allow for enough friction like the wooden stakes. So by placing the T-posts on each end of the row and one in the middle, this ensures plenty of stability for the tomato plants as they continue to grow. Then, in between each plant, he will add a wooden stake to provide additional support. Before, Travis runs his twine along the rows he likes to prune the bottom lateral stems of the plant to ensure the first line of twine is clearly at the base of the tomato plant. With the Gro-Tie twine, you are able to put the box on your belt loop and then with a piece of pipe, he is going to guide the string throughout the garden row. By weaving the string through one plant and around the stake a couple of times then weaving through the next plant along the entire row. Then once you reach the end of the row you should go back through to the opposite side of each plant to provide support on both sides of the plant. As the plants continue to grow and get a little taller you should add more twine to ensure the tomato plants get plenty of support in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF3kfdT7XhQ&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=58&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "Using the High Arch Wheel Hoe to Hill Corn",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:08-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Hilling Corn</h2>\nSome of the important reasons we like to hill corn is for weed control, to prop the corn up, and to create more brace roots at the bottom of the plant. Greg doesn't like to use any herbicides on his corn, therefore small weeds will begin to pop up around the corn plants which is not good. To gain weed control, Greg simply goes down the row with his wheel hoe and throws soil to the plants and in return smothers the weeds out of the area. Another reason we will hill corn is to keep the plant from sulking out down at the bottom which is not needed. It can also make your corn stalks stronger because when we throw soil to the plants we will develop healthier root development in the garden.\n<h2>Process of Hilling Corn</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is demonstrating how to hill corn using the High Arch Wheel Hoe. He is currently growing bloody butcher field corn to make grits and corn mill once it is ready to harvest. However, he also is going to try the <a href=\"/products/jimmy-red-corn/\">Jimmy Red</a> variety which is rare red corn that he has not grown before in the garden. When Greg's corn gets up to about 12 inches tall that is when he likes to hill the corn. When preparing to hill corn, Greg is going to side-dress the corn using Chilean Nitrate because it is a natural form of nitrogen that hits the plants quickly when water reaches it. For hilling corn, we suggest using the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> that has a 15-inch clearance that ensures we get plenty of room that allows us to straddle taller plants. Another advantage of using this wheel hoe is the ability to adjust the furrows in and out depending on spacing needed to hill the plants. After you hill the corn once and it grows taller it will create a higher shade canopy that will almost eliminate the number of weeds germinating in the soil.\n<h2>Planting Field Corn</h2>\nThe best time to plant field corn is during the spring and can be grown throughout the warmer months up until fall. We recommend planting field corn using our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> to provide accurate spacing in the vegetable garden. We also suggest using <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">drip tape irrigation</a> because corn is a heavy feeder and requires plenty of water and fertilizer for growth. When growing corn it is best to avoid overhead watering because the plants grow so tall that the irrigation will not reach the roots effectively in the garden. In order to lay drip tape quick and easy, we prefer to use the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer attachment</a>. In the garden, we can succession plant field corn to get maximum productivity and save space. We can get two succession plantings of field corn when planting in early spring and late summer. Another important factor when planting corn in the garden is to plant in square plots or blocks to ensure the corn receives the needed amount of pollination it requires to develop productive quality ears of corn in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6z8Gybxb-s&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=59&amp;t=54s",

    "title": "Why Should You Be Growing Beets in the Garden?",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:08-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Beets</h2>\nThere are several health benefits when it comes to eating beets. The first benefit to growing beets is they can detoxify your blood and liver. Also, lower your blood pressure and provide lots of antioxidants to fight free radicals. While providing Vitamin C and fiber which is going to help with your digestive system. The last benefit is they can boost your stamina and give you good healthy energy needed for your body.\n<h2>Growing Beets</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is planting beets in the vegetable garden. Travis's favorite beets to plant are the red and gold beets that both have outstanding taste profiles. He is currently on his third succession planting of beets which means he has already harvested some from the garden and is continuing to plant more to get maximum yield of beets throughout the growing season. When dealing with raw beet seed it has a crinkly look that is uneven and looks similar to chard seed. If you plan to plant raw seed using a mechanical planted it is not going to work well so you will need to direct seed instead. However, with the pelleted beet seed, it works much better when planted in our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. We recommend transplanting beets in our seed starting trays to ensure we get better plant growth once they are planted in the garden. If transplanting in the ground the preferred spacing is 4 inches along the row. While direct seeding beets can be done it can also be a little tricky because beets do not germinate as well in certain soil conditions. You can direct seed beets with multiple rows close together and spaced as close to 6 inches apart. When planting beets in the garden, Travis likes to plant them on double rows to ensure he gets maximum spacing and yields during the growing season. In the episode, Travis is using our new<a href=\"/products/dibble-wheel-attachment/\"> Dibble Wheel attachment</a> on his <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> to mark the plant spacing for the beets going down the garden rows.\n<h2>Multigerm vs. Monogerm Beets</h2>\nBeet seeds are naturally multigerm varieties which means that each seed contains more than one embryo. Multigerm seeds happen when flowers grow in clusters which in return produces multigerm seed balls. When the seed balls germinate they produce 2 to 5 seedlings at once. So when planting you will end up with more than one seedling or plant per seed which requires some form of thinning of the plants. The thinning is important to ensure we get large production and uniform beet seeds. For instance, with our beet seeds, we want the same size round beets all along the row in the vegetable garden. In order to get these results, the beets should be evenly spaced along the garden row so we have to thin those to ensure they are 4 to 6 inches apart in the vegetable garden. Monogerm means that each seed contains one seedling per seed or one plant per seed. Therefore if you prefer to direct seed in the ground you should go with a monogerm hybrid variety like our <a href=\"/products/solo-beet/\">Solo Beet</a> variety.\n<h2>Varieties of Beets</h2>\nThere are several different beet varieties that contain all the health benefits we mentioned earlier. The first variety is the <a href=\"/products/detroit-dark-red-beet/\">Detriot Dark Red Beet</a> which is an heirloom that is perfect for baby beet production or for pickling in jars to store for later. The <a href=\"/products/early-wonder-beet/\">Early Wonder Beet</a> is an early-maturing variety that produces harvestable beets around 5 to 10 days quicker than most of the other standard beet varieties. While the <a href=\"/products/kestrel-beet/\">Kestrel Beets</a> are a productive hybrid variety that produces consistently shaped beet roots. It also has an excellent disease package against downy mildew, powdery mildew, and Rhizoctonia. Another variety we offer is the <a href=\"/products/merlin-beet/\">Merlin Beets</a> which contain high sugar content which means it's one of the sweetest beet varieties you can grow in the garden. A different beet is the <a href=\"/products/touchstone-gold-beet/\">Touchstone Gold Beet</a> contains orange to gold skin with a bright yellow flesh interior. This beet retains its unique gold color after harvesting and when cooked with around the homestead.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCCLYGOlxwk&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=60&amp;t=73s",

    "title": "How to Hill Potatoes with the High Arch Wheel Hoe",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:08-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Hill Potatoes?</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is demonstrating how to hill potatoes in the garden. Here in the south, we have experienced a good bit of warm weather which has caused our potatoes to grow quickly and they are around six inches tall. Since the potatoes are around six inches tall it is time to hill the potatoes in the vegetable garden. The two main reasons we hill potatoes is quantity and quality. On a plant, there are three main organs the root, stem, and leaves. The actual potato is a modified stem, not a root, that is used by the plant for storing energy and nutrients. In other words, the more plant we cover leads to the more stems we bury, and that in return gives us more potatoes (modified stems) to harvest at the end of the growing season. Another factor is if we do not hill the plants then the potatoes get exposed to sunlight which causes a buildup of chlorophyll and decreases the greenness of the plants. They can also build up a chemical known as Solanine which is a toxin that can be poisonous if you consume it. Therefore, the quality of potatoes is best when kept buried or underground in the garden.\n<h2>Hilling Potatoes in the Garden</h2>\nWhen planting potatoes they do best when planted in late winter or early spring while the temperatures are relatively still cool. They should be harvested before the heat of summer becomes relevant in the garden area. To begin the hilling potatoes process, the first step is to use the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> and cultivate the pathways between the rows to ensure we have plenty of soil to throw on the plants. Once, the pathways are cultivated it's now time to the potatoes using the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a>. As opposed to the Double Wheel Hoe which has a clearance of around 5-inches, the High Arch has a clearance of 15-inches which allows the potatoes to become bigger before we have to hill them. Another, reason to use the High Arch over the other wheel hoes is your ability to adjust the spacing on your row or plants. For example, if you wanted narrower cultivation on corn or wider cultivation on lettuce. Using the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachments</a> allows you to throw the soil directly to the plants while working along the rows. After, hilling the potatoes this week, Travis mentions he will probably hill them again in another week or two. However, he will move the plows out even wider to create a wider hill onto the potatoes.\n<h2>Potato Varieties</h2>\nWe currently have four different varieties of potatoes that all do great in the vegetable garden. The <a href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\">German Butterball</a> produces medium to large-sized potatoes that contain a buttery-yellow flesh with an excellent flavor profile. The <a href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\">Adirondack Blue</a> is a purple-fleshed potato that is rich in antioxidants and provides maximum yields. Its unique color maintains when cooked and has exceptional flavoring profiles. The <a href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\">Red Norland</a> is known for having exceptional storage and is great for boiling or roasting. It also has better disease resistance to scab, potato virus, and rhizoctonia, unlike other potato varieties. Lastly, <a href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\">Yukon Gold</a> is the most popular and versatile potato variety around the world. It is another variety that produces heavy yields, excellent flavor, and makes medium to large-sized potatoes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V41xkcn3sx0&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=61&amp;t=35s",

    "title": "Planting Ambrosia Sweet Corn with our Garden Seeder",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:08-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Pollination of Sweet Corn</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is planting ambrosia sweet corn in the vegetable garden. Previously planted was crimson clover and Travis decided to let his chickens graze on the spot in order to clean out the area. When planting sweet corn or field corn you always want to plant it in a square plot for better pollination. Corn is a wind-pollinated crop meaning that once the tassels start forming on the tops the male flowers with the pollen will begin to pollinate the female flowers on the ears or silks of the corn. This allows for maximum pollination by planting in a square plot instead of a long row in the garden.\n<h2>Planting Ambrosia Sweet Corn</h2>\nTo start planting <a href=\"/products/ambrosia-sweet-corn/\">Ambrosia Sweet Corn</a> in the garden we begin by laying our drip tape. Corn is a heavy feeder crop meaning it needs lots of irrigation and fertilizer to get the best growth. However, Travis is not going to add compost in the garden since the crimson clover previously planted and grazing chickens added a lot of amending in the soil. We are going to create a furrow using our <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a>. Then, to add drip irrigation in the garden we are going to use our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer attachment</a> to effectively lay the drip in straight rows. Now, Travis is going to plant six rows of Ambrosia Sweet Corn using the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. With the seeder, it has a disc furrow opener and we can plant right on top of the drip tape without puncturing the drip tape that is already buried in the garden. Before we plant, we always want to test to make sure the seeds will fit the correct seed plate and modify the plate if they do not fit the sweet corn variety. When planting six rows of corn, Travis recommends planting with 30 or 36-inch spacing. Next, he will plant his Ambrosia sweet corn along the rows in the square plot of the vegetable garden. Finally, after planting he will ensure that his drip irrigation is running effectively and wait for the germination of sweet corn to begin in the garden area.\n<h2>Three Levels of Sweetness</h2>\nThere are three categories when it comes to sweet corn varieties. They are broken up into levels of sweetness and length of storage capacity after harvest. The first level is Su which is the standard type that is typically the older sweet corn varieties such as <a href=\"/products/silver-queen-sweet-corn/\">Silver Queen</a> or <a href=\"/products/stowells-evergreen-sweet-corn/\">Stowell's Evergreen</a>. The second level is a sugary extender known as Se which tends to be sweeter than the Su type and can store a little longer after harvest. The sugary extender type includes varieties like Ambrosia, <a href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\">Incredible</a>, and <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\">Peaches and Cream</a>. Lastly, the Sh2 is a supersweet or triplesweet type that is the sweetest of corn varieties and has the longest storage rate after harvesting from the garden. We have one variety that is Sh2 which is the <a href=\"/products/honey-select-sweet-corn/\">Honey Select</a> hybrid variety that has the perfect combination of corn flavor and sweetness.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hafPx9q2zOA&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=62&amp;t=0s",

The first step to preparing the garden for planting tomatoes is to set up the <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">drip irrigation</a>. Travis went ahead and laid the mainline tubing down the day before planting to allow the newly laid tape to stretch out and lay flat. He ran four rows of drip tape for not just tomatoes, but eggplants and peppers as well. Once the drip irrigation system is set up, then we allow water to fill the tape to ensure we get accurate planting where the drip emitters lay along the rows. With the drip emitters laying every 12 inches which allow a good indication for spacing if you prefer to plant every other emitter for two-foot spacing or every third emitter for three-foot spacing. Travis prefers to plant tomatoes in the <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> to get more productive plants for growing in the garden. When planting tomatoes, they require some form of support to keep the plants growing upright. With the indeterminate tomatoes, Travis is planting with tomato cages on a three-foot spacing to allow plenty of room for growth all season long. While planting determinate tomatoes on two-foot spacing with stakes and twine to use the <a href=\"&amp;t=7s\">Florida Weave Trellis</a> technique. When planting, Travis likes to apply a little <a href=\"/products/pelletized-gypsum-soil-conditioner/\">pelleted gypsum</a> at the base of the plant to help with preventing blossom end rot from destroying the tomato plants. After adding the gypsum, we plant the transplants real deep to allow the roots to form out from the stems and provide an anchor for the plant. Once, the plants have started growing and get a little taller then Travis will add the <a href=\"/products/tomato-cages/\">tomato cages</a> to the indeterminate tomatoes. To add the tomato cages you simply put it square around the plant and push into the ground. When using the Florida weave technique we need T-post, wooden stakes, and <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">twine</a>. Travis starts by adding the T-post to each end of the row and one T-post in the middle of the row. Next, he will add the wooden stakes between the T-post and every plant. As the plants grow, Travis will add the twine to provide plenty of support for the heavy yields of fruits in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Harvesting Tomatoes</h2>\nThe best time to harvest tomatoes is once you have reached the end of the growing season, which is typically late summer. When tomatoes have reached there full mature green stage, you know they are ready to pick. If you watch the bottom of the larger tomatoes, typically that is where it begins to ripen as well. You can also test the firmness of the tomato by lightly squeezing it. After, all tomatoes have been harvested it is very important to remove the plants and clean the area to avoid pests and diseases from taking over the garden. To properly remove the tomato cages after harvesting, Travis takes his <a href=\"/products/pruning-shears/\">pruning shears</a> and cuts the stems around 10 inches above the soil to allow him to pull the cages out of the ground. For tomatoes that were on the Florida weave trellis, he simply uses his knife to cut the twine, and remove the T-post/wooden stakes. Then, Travis will remove the tomato plants by the root mass and place them in a burn pile. We place the plants in a burn pile in order to kill off all the fungal spores and insect eggs that remain on the plants after harvesting to ensure they do not cause any future pest and disease issues in the garden.\n\n&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=63&amp;t=66s\n            <div class=\"video-container\">\n              <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0y_WtCIbs7k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n            </div>\n          ",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:05-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Transplants</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg decided to plant some beet, bok choy, and broccoli transplants using the new Hoss Dibble Wheel. Back in the day, Greg just cut a stick to his desired spacing and used it to determine the spacing between each plant in the garden. However, with the new dibble wheel, it lays off the desired spacing perfectly for planting transplants. When planting the broccoli, he adjusted the dibbles to turn in every other one which makes the spacing around 10 inches between plants. The <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> make perfect plug transplants for the dibble wheel indentions made into the soil. To ensure the transplants are ready for planting they will simply pull out of the trays with a breeze making them ready to plant in the ground. If you have sandy-like soils the best time to use the dibble wheel is when there is a little moisture to help hold that opening you punch into the ground using the dibble. With clay-like soils, the dibble wheel should do fine leaving an opening or indention in the soil. If you use drip irrigation you can still see where it lays if buried because there is a split in the soil where it lays and you need to straddle that split using the dibble wheel to ensure you don't puncture the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a>. You can basically plant any kind of seeds, transplants, or bulbs using our dibble wheel attachment to ensure you get the perfect amount of spacing, straight rows within the vegetable garden, and efficient planting is done.\n<h2>Benefits of Planting Transplants</h2>\nThere are a couple of benefits to planting transplants instead of direct seeding. The first benefit is a quicker jumpstart to the growing season. By having plants growing in the greenhouse you can start prior to the desired growing season allowing you to plant the transplants as soon as the weather conditions are just right. Another benefit of planting transplants is more productive crops. Due to the transplants starting their early life stage in the greenhouse, they are reduced from being affected by pests, diseases, and inaccurate weather conditions that could ultimately harm them if they started in the garden. In other words, starting transplants in the greenhouse will allow you to have stronger and healthier plants that create maximum yields in the garden.\n<h2>Hoss Dibble Wheel Attachment</h2>\nThe purpose of the Hoss Dibble Wheel is to make indentions into the soil for planting transplants and seeds in the garden. With the <a href=\"/products/dibble-wheel-attachment/\">Dibble Wheel Attachment</a>, we offer a single, double, or triple wheel kit. Each wheel has adjustable dibble spacing and wheel spacing to fit your desired planting needs in the vegetable garden. Each dibble wheel has 12 holes and may be arranged for plant spacing of 4\", 8\", 12\", 16\", 24\", and 48 inches. This attachment works on the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a>, <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a>, and the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a>. However, when using on the High Arch we suggest getting two of the Single Dibble Wheel Kits, to ensure the unit is stable and equally balanced on the wheel hoe. With the Single Dibble Wheel, the wheel sits inside the attachment bracket and is secured using the should bolt axle. The standard axle length is 15 inches long, but we can make a 30-inch axle or easily cut one for whatever size you need. With each multi-wheel kit, we include lock collars that allow you to lock the wheels in place along the axle.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Vt5CRf1IA&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=64&amp;t=77s",

    "title": "Growing the Best Potato Varieties in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:05-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Potato Varieties</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is planting the best potatoes in the garden. When planting potatoes he likes to plant them around the end of February. Some of the potato varieties that he plans on growing this season are <a href=\"https://irisheyesgardenseeds.com/product/jelly-potato-organic/\">Jelly</a>, <a href=\"https://irisheyesgardenseeds.com/product/blue-belle-potato-organic/\">Blue Belle</a>, and <a href=\"https://irisheyesgardenseeds.com/product/red-pontiac-organic/\">Red Pontiac</a> potato. The Jelly variety produces a large potato that has a nice yellow color that contains a buttery flavor profile. The next variety is known as Blue Belle which contains a little bluish color outside and produces a smaller potato but is very productive in the garden. Lastly, the Red Pontiac variety is an old standard potato that is really accessible anywhere. Along with Irish Eyes potatoes, we also carry several varieties of potatoes that are really productive such as <a href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\">Red Norland</a>, <a href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\">Yukon Gold</a>, <a href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\">Adirondack Blue</a>, and <a href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\">German Butterball</a>.\n<h2>Preparing Potatoes for Planting</h2>\nWhen cutting up seed potatoes, Greg recommends cutting at least two or three eyes off at a time, which ends making little slices of potato. If you have a potato that does not have well-defined eyes you can just cut the potato in half. After you get done cutting the seed potatoes, then we use fir bark dust fertilizer which is used to heal newly cut seed potatoes so you can basically plant them the same day you cut them. The fir bark dust is also slightly acidic which in return helps as a fungicide, keeping diseases out of your seed potatoes. Greg just pours the fir bark dust over the freshly cut seed potatoes and stirs it around to get good coverage. Once the fir bark has been added to the seed potatoes they are ready for planting in the garden. If you do not plan on using the fir back dust to heal potatoes, you should allow a couple of days for the seed potatoes to \"heal\" or suberize before the desired planting date.\n<h2>Planting the Best Potatoes</h2>\nAs a cool-weather crop, potatoes do best when planted in late winter or early spring when temperatures are still relatively cool. When planting the potatoes, Greg uses the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> because of its many adjustable abilities for whatever you need in the garden. The first adjustment, Greg will make with the high arch is a position for digging a furrow for the plants. Next, he will adjust the plows to turn out and create a hilling position so he can cover them up in the garden. When planting potatoes be sure to plant with the \"eyes\" facing upwards in the vegetable garden. Greg ended up planting four rows of the different potato varieties. After the potatoes start to come up and it's time to hill them, we will take the high arch and move the spacing out to create a wider hill with our plow attachment in order to throw more soil to the plants. Potatoes tend to not do well once temperatures begin to warm up, so they should be harvested before the summer heat conditions.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTvGrDODbs&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=65&amp;t=553s",

    "title": "Overcoming Too Much Rain in the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:03-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Biggest Con of Too Much Rain</h2>\nThe biggest problem with accumulating too much rain in the garden is disease pressure. Some of the diseases that could overtake the garden include powdery mildew, fire blight, and anthracnose. However, if you monitor the garden and have a prevention plan set in place to eliminate these disease issues you could save your plants from becoming completely ruined in the garden.\n<h2>Vegetable Garden Update</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis mentions ways to deal with too much rain in the vegetable garden. Here in South Georgia, we have recently dealt with the coldest and wettest winters thus far which has caused us to overcome some challenges when dealing with our crops that are planted in the ground. One area of the garden has been established for around four years which means it has accumulated a good amount of organic matter and been able to reduce the weed seedbed in the ground. In other words, this area of the garden is extremely manageable when it comes to growing vegetables in the plot.\n<h3>Greens Mix</h3>\nTravis currently has a <a href=\"/products/premium-greens-mix/\">Premium Greens Mix</a> that has done well considering the amount of rain we have experienced in the garden. He planted the mix with the <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/seeders/home/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> on a 30-inch bed and squeezed in as many rows has he could to get a maximum yield of greens mix. Typically, we can harvest this crop at least three times along the garden bed.\n<h3>Onions</h3>\nA positive of a lot of rain is that the onion plants are completely loving it. In the garden, there are six double rows of Red and <a href=\"/products/texas-legend-onion/\">Texas Legend</a> onions planted. The Red Onions seem to be growing quicker than the Texas Legends so far, but Travis has been keeping them fertilized and is really excited about harvesting these crops soon.\n<h3>Carrots</h3>\nNext to the onions plants, Travis has different multicolored carrots such as purple, red, orange, and yellow plants growing that should be ready to harvest around late spring or early summer. We also have five double rows of carrots that are getting overrun with weeds due to the amount of moisture in the soil. Travis can't really do too much about the weeds since he planted them as intensively as he could, but the carrots are still doing well overall.\n<h3>Crimson Clover</h3>\nTravis has a cover crop of <a href=\"/products/crimson-clover/\">crimson clover</a> still being worked on by some chickens. He has a chicken tractor and poultry netting placed in the area that allows the chickens to freely roam within the netting allowing them to graze and provide good manure in the area.\n<h3>Toscano Kale</h3>\nThe kale that is currently planted, Travis has harvested around five or six times and will continue to harvest throughout the growing season. To harvest a few, he just pulls off the bottom leaves and allows the top leaves to remain on the stalk to keep growing taller.\n<h3>Empty Garden Plots</h3>\nFor the remaining plots in the garden that have not been planted yet, Travis has tons of transplants growing in the greenhouse that will be placed in the ground as soon as they are ready. Some of the early spring transplants that are growing are kale, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, and lettuce. He also has an area planned for planting potatoes as soon as he gets them in the mail from <a href=\"https://irisheyesgardenseeds.com/\">Irish Eyes</a>. Travis also shows off a brand new garden plot that he has added to his homestead. This area has been tilled once and he plans to till it once a week until spring to help eliminate weed pressures in the new garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBdwz_YUsaU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=66&amp;t=116s",

    "title": "Why Leave Your Everyday Desk Job for Sustainable Farming",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:03-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Should You Have a Sustainable Farm?</h2>\nThe three main objectives of sustainable farming is to create a healthy environment, economic profitability, and social/economic equity. This way of farming is to seek techniques that will promote farming practices that will help improve the soil environment and are economically good for the community. Unlike commercial farming, sustainable farming focuses on producing crops that have not been sprayed with harsh chemical pesticides, insecticides, and fertilizers. This makes for a safer growing environment and healthier producing plants in the vegetable garden. Along with having a healthy environment, a sustainable farm allows you to save money around the homestead. By producing your own food you are saving the amount of money you spend in supermarkets and increase your supply of healthier crops grown in the garden.\n<h2>Methods of Sustainable Farming</h2>\nThere are a couple of different methods or techniques when it comes to sustainable farming. The first method is crop rotation which is the process of rotating crops to avoid planting the same crop in the same area every year. If one crop is planted in the same area every year you will cause pest problems and reduce soil nutrients in the garden. Accurate crop rotation helps eliminate the reproduction cycle of pests and will replenish soil nutrients because of the different crop benefits being planted. Another technique of sustainable farming is planting cover crops to improve soil build-up. With warm-season and cool-season cover crops such as <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>, <a href=\"/products/crimson-clover/\">Crimson Clover</a>, and <a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\">Tillage Radish</a> there are plenty of benefits that ensure improvement is being incorporated back into the soil. The third effective method of sustainable farming is the use of good compost for soil enrichment. Travis and Greg are believers in the FAD system which is furrow, amend, and drip. When creating a furrow this allows for a destinated place to plant the crops. Once the furrow is created, you can amend the furrow with a good quality of compost which will improve the overall garden soil. Then, by adding <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> we can effectively supply the growing plants with the needed amount of irrigation in the vegetable garden. We recommend using quality compost such as cow manure or chicken manure to get the best results in the garden. One more method of sustainable farming is integrating livestock to help with the garden. Allowing livestock such as cows, chickens, goats, or pigs to graze on crops after harvesting can create organic matter in the soil, feed the animals, and allows the garden to be worked in different ways depending on each animal.\n<h2>The Lazy Acres Family Farm</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is at <a href=\"https://thelazyacres.com/\">The Lazy Acres Family Farm</a> in Marianna, Florida talking with Ryan Ziglar about leaving his everyday desk job for sustainable farming. Ryan used to own a video production company but wanted to leave this to pursue a healthier lifestyle and spend more time with family in the future. Ryan showed off his garden area where in the winter he planned to plant wheat, rye, and oats. He also planted a cool-season cover crop known as <a href=\"/products/hairy-vetch/\">Hairy Vetch</a> to improve his nitrogen within the garden soil. Before it was a small garden, Ryan mentions that the area where his garden is now used to be farmed for row crops meaning four to five rows of different crops. Along with compost, Ryan has livestock such as cows, goats, and pigs to help forage the garden. His favorite animal to use in the garden is cows because they supply the ground with lots of manure in a quick amount of time.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tiV2h_HEZg&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=67&amp;t=184s",

    "title": "Improve Soils with Chickens and Cover Crops",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:01-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Building Up Soils in the Vegetable Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis shows how he uses the chicken and cover crops to improve soils in the vegetable garden. He set up the <a href=\"https://www.premier1supplies.com/p/electrostop-fence-starter-kit-sheep-goats?cat_id=160\">poultry fence</a> and added the chicken tractor inside the fencing to allow the chickens to cover more area in the garden than just inside the coop. The poultry fence comes with a solar panel charger to provide an electric charge net to keep predators away and chicken inside. You can adjust the angle of the solar panel based on the growing seasons to help with keeping the panels charged and working correctly in the vegetable garden. Travis plans to let the chickens forage on the crimson clover till they basically knock it all down, then he will move the fence and chicken tractor to the other side of the garden. He will move the fence and tractor back and forth for about a month till it's time to prepare the garden for planting.\n<h2>Chicken Tractor</h2>\nA chicken tractor is usually a mobile chicken coop that contains wheels, it is small enough to move around from one spot to another as well as rotate around certain areas. There are several different designs of chicken tractors available online, but Travis built one for himself that is 4 inches wide by 12 to 13 inches long. It has a 4×4 enclosure that is shaded allowing them to cool off during the hotter days and it contains nesting boxes and food/water boxes. Some benefits to using a chicken tractor in the garden include providing natural fertilization, chickens will eliminate overwintering insects, and they can shallow till garden beds. Overall, the chicken tractor is a really good way to utilize what livestock you have on the homestead to improve garden soils for planting in the future.\n<h2>Cover Crop: Crimson Clover</h2>\nTravis has planted <a href=\"/products/crimson-clover/\">Crimson Clover</a> to help eliminate weed pressures, add nitrogen to the soil, improve soil workability, and supplies feed for the chickens on the homestead. This cool-season cover crop is a legume that fixes nitrogen and adds in back into the soil which improves the overall soil quality in the garden. It should be planted in the fall at least a month or two before the average frost date. Planting ahead will ensure that the cover crop can germinate and establish in the garden before cold temperatures arrive. The clover should be incorporated into the soil or livestock can graze on the crop to remove it from the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Other Cover Crops</h2>\nThere are various different cover crops that offer plenty of characteristics that help improve the garden soil. Some popular cool-season cover crops include <a href=\"/products/florida-broadleaf-mustard/\">Broadleaf Mustard</a>, <a href=\"/products/hairy-vetch/\">Hairy Vetch</a>, <a href=\"/products/austrian-winter-pea/\">Austrian Winter Pea</a> and <a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\">Tillage Radish</a>. While some well-known warm-season cover crops include <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a>, <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>, and <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a>. You can also make a cover crop cocktail with some of these varieties to obtain different benefits in one area. Most of these cover crop characteristics help with nitrogen fixation, erosion control, weed suppression, pest control, and improve soils. In order for these cover crop characteristics to really work in the soil, they must be mowed down or tilled in and incorporated back into the ground. If they are not incorporated back into the soil they can cause reseeding and weed issues in the future growing seasons.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzR-9yY6bYo&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=39&amp;t=110s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:00-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Removing Weeds</h2>\nThere are several benefits of removing weeds from the vegetable garden such as improved plant growth and garden soil. Weeds can cause restricts on plant growth due to them competing for nutrients, soil, water, and space that the plants you are trying to get growth development. One more issue with weeds in the garden is they may even smother smaller plants that are trying to germinate or prevent them from growing at all. Also, some invasive weeds can destroy a habitat and damage all the native plants that grow there. To avoid these harsh and invasive weeds it is best to remove them quickly before they become a bigger problem and destroy the plant growth in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Weeding Carrots and Onions</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is using two tools to demonstrate for weeding carrots and onions. In the garden, Travis has five rows of carrots that are planted on double rows with drip tape buried in the middle. He recommends planting on double rows because we get the most utility out of drip tape and once the carrots get bigger they will help shade out in the middle area where the drip tape is buried. The first tool that Travis suggests using when weeding carrots and onions is the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a>. Since the single wheel hoe is smaller it has an advantage over the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">double wheel hoe</a> when it comes to weeding in the vegetable garden. With the <a href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\">cultivator teeth attachment</a>, it makes weeding carrots and onions easier and quicker between tight rows of planted plants in the garden. However, when needing to weed on top of the beds and in between the plants along the double row the best tool to use is the <a href=\"/products/single-tine-cultivator/\">Single Tine Cultivator</a>. When using this cultivator, Travis turns it sideways to skim across the area to remove weeds in tight spaces and avoid damaging the drip tape that is already buried in the garden.\n<h2>Additional Way to Remove Weeds</h2>\nIf you experience a serious problem with weeds in the garden another way to suppress those weed pressures is by growing cover crops in the garden. Some cover crops like <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a>, <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, <a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\">Daikon Radish</a>, and <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> all have characteristics that grow faster in order to outpace weed growth. When planting cover crops we prefer to use our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> to get precise planting in the vegetable garden. When growing cover crops the key to making them succeed in the garden is they should be incorporated back into the soil before going to seed to prevent reseeding problems.\n<h2>Carrot and Onion Varieties</h2>\nThere are a couple of popular carrot and onion varieties that are known to be the best to grow in the vegetable garden. Some of the carrot varieties include <a href=\"/products/danvers-126-carrot-pelleted/\">Danvers</a>, <a href=\"/products/scarlet-nantes-carrot-pelleted/\">Scarlet Nantes</a>, <a href=\"/products/bolero-carrot-pelleted/\">Bolero</a> and <a href=\"/products/viper-carrot-pelleted/\">Viper</a>. The best way to grow carrots is by direct seeding in a think band along the rows in the vegetable garden. The well-known onion varieties include <a href=\"/products/texas-legend-onion/\">Texas Legend</a>, <a href=\"/products/candy-onion/\">Candy</a>, <a href=\"/products/savannah-sweet-onion/\">Savannah Sweet</a>, and <a href=\"/products/warrior-bunching-onion/\">Warrior Bunching</a>. When growing onions they should be planted on drip tape to ensure they get an accurate amount of irrigation in the garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oErHJnKiGhc&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=40&amp;t=23s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:00-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing the Best Onions</h2>\nIt's that time of year to be thinking about growing onions in the vegetable garden. When growing the best onions we recommend either transplanting or direct seeding. If you prefer to transplant plants you can grow onions in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> for improved germination. The trays contain internal vertical root training ribs that improve aeration and root ball drainage that ensure properly germinated and growing transplants. When direct seeding you can use our walk-behind <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> with the #1 seed plant and modify the hole size to accommodate the onions seed size properly when planting. The seeder makes it quicker and easier to plant seeds without worrying about overplanting along the garden rows.\n<h2>Planting the Onions</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is discussing different ways to grow the best onions in the vegetable garden. In the garden, Travis is getting ready to plant the <a href=\"https://www.dixondalefarms.com/product/red-creole/short_day_onions\">Red Creole</a> and <a href=\"/products/texas-legend-onion/\">Texas Legend</a> variety of onions. Before planting onions, Travis has prepared the vegetable garden by using the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">drip tape layer attachment</a> to lay tape along the garden rows and create a nice little furrow for planting onions. He plans on planting six rows of onion plants on a double row system in the garden. This means that along the drip tape he will plant on either side of the tape where the little furrows were established when laying drip tape in the garden. Another benefit of planting on double rows is you get better efficiency by saving space in the garden and maximizing yield. Travis is planting the onion plants around six inches apart to ensure they get plenty of room for growth. Once a week, Travis will use the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> down the middle of the rows to help control the weeds from being an issue in the vegetable garden. He also likes to use his <a href=\"/products/single-tine-cultivator/\">Single Tine Cultivator</a> to run in between the onion plants until they get big enough to shade out the area of weed germination. Since onions are heavy feeders they need plenty of nutrient inputs to continue productive growth in the vegetable garden. We recommend using the <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> and <a href=\"/products/ammonium-sulfate/\">Ammonium Sulfate</a> fertilizer to maintain solid root development and vegetative growth of onion plants in the garden.\n<h2>Different Onion Varieties</h2>\nThere are several onion varieties that are hands down the best onions to grow in the vegetable garden. The first variety is the well known Texas Legend onions. This variety produces uniform yellow bulbs that have a mild to sweet flavor profile. Another well-known onion variety is <a href=\"/products/candy-onion/\">Candy</a> which is a hybrid that does well in a wide range of conditions. This variety produces a sweeter tasting onion that has round bulbs that are slightly flattened in the garden. The <a href=\"/products/warrior-bunching-onion/\">Warrior Bunching</a> onions are a fast-growing variety that produces crisp nice green tops and overall easy to grow. This variety does really well when left in the garden to grow in return allowing us to get a longer harvesting window. Next, is the <a href=\"/products/savannah-sweet-onion/\">Savannah Sweet</a> onions that are a Vidalia-type variety that has early maturity dates than other varieties.  While the <a href=\"/products/walla-walla-onion/\">Walla Walla</a> variety performs great in the northern climates and contains a milder or sweeter flavor profile similar to Vidalia type onions. Another variety is the <a href=\"/products/sweet-harvest-onion/\">Sweet Harvest</a> onions that contain higher sugar content and low pungency. This variety produces larger to jumbo size bulbs that are fairly bolt resistant during the late spring. Lastly, the <a href=\"/products/natsuguro-bunching-onion/\">Natsuguro Bunching</a> variety has an extreme heat-tolerance into the warmer months and can be planted throughout the spring months while harvesting happens in the summer months.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTmJYkunmrw&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=41&amp;t=39s",

    "title": "Best Way to Reuse Drip Tape in the Fall Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:58-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Using Drip Tape</h2>\nThe easiest way to maximize garden production with effective irrigation and steady water-soluble fertilizers is through the use of drip tape. Most people believe that drip tape can be used either on top or buried in the soil. However, drip tape was really made to go underneath the soil in the garden. This allows the irrigation tape to stay in place, decrease disease pressure and reduce damage caused by natural causes. It also provides plenty of needed nutrients for plant growth and healthier plants in the vegetable garden. Not only does it apply equal amounts of irrigation to the plants, but it conserves water by going directly to the plant roots in the vegetable garden, unlike overhead irrigation systems.\n<h2>How to Reuse Drip Tape</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is explaining how to reuse drip tape in the vegetable garden. Since we like to plant in the garden year-round, we reuse our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> for multiple growing seasons at a time. Travis currently has red cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and Brussel sprouts planted. As well as, harvested some broccoli and swiss chard from the vegetable garden. There is currently an empty spot where he had his bok choy variety planted, but now it's time to plant another vegetable variety. When reusing drip tape we simply clean up the area and lay the drip tape back down to plant more in the garden. In order to reuse the drip tape, Travis is going to leave the drip tape attached to the <a href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\">mainline</a> of tubing and pull the buried drip tape out of the ground in order to lay that piece of tape out the garden area. Then, he will take his <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> to cultivate and remove any weeds from the area before replanting. Next, Travis is going to use the F.A.D. system to lay the drip tape back into the vegetable garden. Which the F.A.D. system stands for furrow, amend, and then drip. So first he will create a little furrow using the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a> which will establish a place to lay the drip tape in the garden. Then, we will amend the furrow by laying good compost in the area. Finally, we will lay the drip tape back in the garden with the emitters facing upward for planting. However, Travis wants to move the drip tape that is attached to the mainline tubing over around five or six inches for planting lettuce. In order to move the tape over, he will take a <a href=\"/products/goof-plugs/\">goof plug</a> to fill the existing hole and move the tape over a little bit then punch a new hole in the mainline tubing. When the drip tape is laid in the garden where it needs to be then we will simply cover it up for burying. Normally, Travis would use the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">double wheel hoe</a> with the plow set in the hilling position to straddle and cover the rows up. However, since he is only covering one line of drip tape he will just take the <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">dura rake</a> and cover it up in the garden. Once the drip tape is buried, we suggest turning the water on and letting the emitters seep out to indicate where we should put our lettuce plants. To ensure the lettuce plants receive the needed amount of irrigation and spacing, Travis likes to plant them right on top of the drip tape emitters.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKs0bFNcsf8&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=43&amp;t=50s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:58-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Mixed Greens</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is demonstrating how to easily plant mixed greens in the vegetable garden. We recommended using the wheel hoe and garden seeder to create these productive elevated green beds in the garden. You can use either the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> or the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and attach one plow blade to help throw dirt to the middle. Then, Travis will take a <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">rake</a> to smooth out the area and apply compost to prepare the beds for planting mixed greens. Once the beds are prepared for planting, it's time to plant with our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. The seeder has six seed plates that ensure accurate planting of various seed size varieties. Travis is using the number one seed plate for planting mixed greens meaning we will get a little over 1-inch spacing which would be good and tight for the beds we are planting in. Travis planted the mixed greens about a quarter-inch deep in the garden and allowed the weight of the garden seeder to compact and press the seed down for great seed to soil contact for germination. Another important key to planting mixed greens is they need to be hand-watered about twice a day in order to get excellent germination until they come up and get established in the garden. If you prefer to transplant the mixed greens we recommend using our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. This ensures the plants will develop solid root balls that will make germination and productivity better when planted in the garden.\n<h2>Mixed Green Varieties</h2>\nThe <a href=\"/products/premium-greens-mix/\">premium greens mix</a> that we offer has a combination of popular greens that are used in salads, stir-frys, or any other lettuce substituted dish in the kitchen. When harvesting this mixed greens variety use a sharp knife and cut the leaves off once they have reached your desired size. If you want a little more milder flavor green, you should harvest when the leaves are rather small. If you prefer a bolder flavor allow your leaves to grow larger before harvesting from the garden. The mixed greens will continue to grow all throughout the growing season for a productive repeat harvesting. The different varieties that the premium greens mix includes are tatsoi, mizuna, arugula, and red Russian kale. The <a href=\"/products/tatsoi-greens/\">Tatsoi greens</a> are an Asian style mustard variety that makes really productive smaller leaves with excellent flavor profiles. Then, the <a href=\"/products/mizuna-greens/\">Mizuna greens</a> contain a milder flavor profile, excellent texture, and bright green appearance. While the <a href=\"/products/arugula/\">Arugula</a> produces the longer darker leaves that do best when planted during the cool season growing months. This variety of green is known to be easier to germination and have maximum production in the vegetable garden. Lastly, the <a href=\"/products/red-russian-kale/\">Red Russian Kale</a> contains flat leaves that have purple veins that will intensify when encountered with frost.\n<h2>Other Green Varieties</h2>\nAlong with the greens varieties, we offer a few productive mustard varieties for the vegetable garden. The <a href=\"/products/southern-giant-curled-mustard/\">Southern Giant Curled</a> mustard is known as a southern favorite and produces larger yields for crisp and curled leaves that have the traditional \"mustard green\" flavor profile. Another popular mustard variety is the <a href=\"/products/florida-broadleaf-mustard/\">Florida Broadleaf</a> that produces light green smooth leaves that can be harvested early as baby leaf or left in the garden to grow to full size for a larger harvest. The <a href=\"/products/red-mustard-greens/\">Red Mustard Green</a> is another variety that contains a rather bolder flavor profile that will intensify as the greens become larger in the vegetable garden. This variety works well for multiple harvestings throughout the growing seasons. It also does well in any salad mix or stir-fry recipes around the homestead.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7-gN9y5V0&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=44&amp;t=86s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:58-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Preparing for Fall Planting</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is demonstrating how to prepare for fall garden planting. He recently has added on a new plot for gardening and it is a 20 foot wide by around 35 feet long area. Originally this plot was just grass and in order to prepare it for planting, Travis tilled the area during the summer and since then has tilled it about once a week for a month to break up all the grass. Then, after that, he started to use his <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">single wheel hoe</a> to maintain the weeds until it comes time to plant in the garden. Travis is planning on planting five different vegetables such as green magic broccoli, Denali cauliflower, Toscano kale, rainbow swiss chard, and bok choy. To begin preparing the garden for planting, Travis is going to start by using the wheel hoe and cultivate the area to get rid of any small weeds. Next, we laid off our five rows to be three feet apart in the garden. Then, Travis uses the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a> to begin preparing the garden with furrows where the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> will lay. Once, the drip tape is laid then it is time to set up the drip irrigation system such as the <a href=\"/products/filter-regulator-combo/\">Filter Regulator Combo</a> and <a href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\">Mainline Tubing</a>. When everything is set up we turn the irrigation system on and let it run for a while to let the water start seeping up out of the soil where the emitters are for planting. Travis is going to plant right on top of the emitters to ensure that each plant is effectively getting the needed amount of irrigation right to the plant roots for overall better production.\n<h3>Green Magic Brocolli</h3>\nA heat-tolerant variety of broccoli the <a href=\"/products/green-magic-broccoli/\">Green Magic</a> does best when grown during late spring and early fall. This broccoli produces uniform heads that are slow to bolt and go to seed which allows for excellent texture and flavor when harvested from the vegetable garden. It is time to harvest broccoli once the crowns become dark green before any seeds or flowers develop on the crowns.\n<h3>Snow Bowl Cauliflower</h3>\nThis hybrid variety is known for having bright white cauliflower heads that are uniform and well wrapped producing great flavor and tender texture in the garden. The <a href=\"/products/snow-bowl-cauliflower/\">Snow Bowl</a> variety does best when planted during the fall so you are able to harvest in the winter. We suggest transplanting cauliflower to ensure you get consistent planting spacing, effective germination, and better production.\n<h3>Lacinato Kale</h3>\nOne of the most productive crops to grow in the garden is the <a href=\"/products/lacinato-kale/\">Lacinato Kale</a>. This is an Italian heirloom variety that produces long and slender blue to green leaves year-round in the vegetable garden. It is a cold-tolerant crop, but it is also resistant to bolting during the warmer months too.\n<h3>Bright Lights Swiss Chard</h3>\nA colorful blend twist of swiss chard is the <a href=\"/products/bright-lights-swiss-chard/\">Bright Lights</a> that works great for baby leaf or full leaf production. The different leaf colors include shades of orange, pink, red, and green. An All American Selections winner, this swiss chard variety has excellent bolt tolerance for extended harvests into the late spring and early summer growing seasons.\n<h3>Pak Choi</h3>\nA popular Chinese cabbage variety that produces darker leaves and stems with upright heads is the <a href=\"/products/feng-qing-pak-choi/\">Pak Choi</a>. This is an excellent heat and cold tolerant variety that does well throughout the spring and fall growing seasons. You can either direct seed this cabbage variety with our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> or transplant with our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvmqqgAvwzU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=45&amp;t=3s",

    "title": "Fertilizing the Garden with a Chicken Tractor",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:55-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What is a Chicken Tractor?</h2>\nA chicken tractor is basically a mobile chicken coop that does not have a floor. Usually containing wheels, it is small enough to move around from one spot to another and rotate around certain areas. There are several different designs of chicken tractors available online, but Travis built one for himself that is 4 inches wide by 12 to 13 inches long. It has a 4x4 enclosure that is shaded allowing them to cool off during the hotter days and it contains nesting boxes and food/water boxes. In order to expand the possibilities of our chickens and the chicken tractor, we have looked into getting a <a href=\"https://www.premier1supplies.com/p/permanet-plus-48-inch-starter-kit?cat_id=190\">poultry fence kit</a> that will allow the chickens to fertilize and cover more area in the vegetable garden. Some benefits to using a chicken tractor in the garden include providing natural fertilization, chickens will dispose of overwintering insects, and they can shallow till garden beds. Overall, the chicken tractor can prepare the garden soil and minimize the inputs you have to supply when you start growing your own vegetables.\n<h2>Fertilizing the Garden with Chickens</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is incorporating his chicken tractor to fertilize the vegetable garden. In the vegetable garden, Travis has an area that normally gets planted on year-round causing the soil to get depleted quickly. Along with getting planted on year-round the heat temperatures in the south cause the organic matter to burn up leaving the soil depleted of nutrients as well. In return, we have to come up with ways to add more nutrients back to the soil to fulfill our plant needs. So Travis decided to use a chicken tractor to effectively have a way to get rid of leftover crops and move fertilize around the garden area allowing us to incorporate the nutrients back into the soil. In the garden, the chickens have been grazing on the leftover <a href=\"/products/zipper-cream-pea/\">zipper cream peas</a> which in return adds lots of nutrients back into the soil instead of Travis pulling the peas up and placing them in the compost pile. So Travis puts them on the plot which contains four rows or two double rows of peas and basically move the chicken tractor up and down the rows. The chickens remain on a certain spot for around five to seven days then move the tractor down a little bit where fresh vegetation is located. In addition to using the chickens to remove old plant debris, we also like to use them with our cover cropping in the fall as well. For example, we can plant <a href=\"/products/crimson-clover/\">crimson clover</a> in the garden and rotate the chicken tractor around the plot to keep the clover mowed down.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kze6bMnHWo8&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=46&amp;t=42s",

    "title": "Building Up Your Garden Soils with Cover Crops",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:55-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Cover Crops for Improved Garden Soils</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is discussing how to build up the soil by using cover crops. The many benefits of growing cover crops are the increase of organic matter, nematode suppression, and weed control. When building up your garden soils you have to supply the best cover crop that fulfills the characteristics you are wanting to replenish in the soil.\n<h2>Warm vs. Cool Cover Crops</h2>\nWhen deciding which cover crop variety to grow in the garden you also have to think about the weather temperatures in your area. The warmer cover crops we have available are Brown Top Millet, Sorghum Sudangrass, Buckwheat, and Sunn Hemp. The <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> variety provides excellent livestock foliage and green manure for adding in organic matter in the garden soils. It is a variety that is ideal for weed suppression, improving soil tilth, adding nutrients to the soil, and improves water retention. When it comes to planting <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a> it contains deeply penetrated roots that help loosen the compacted soil which in return provides better soil aeration and soil drainage. If you struggle with nematode problems in your garden this sudangrass is an excellent variety that helps suppress nematode populations. Another warmer cover crop is the <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a> variety that is known for being fast-growing which allows for quick turnover in the vegetable garden. It can be squeezed in smaller windows such as spring and fall plantings when you want to break off pest and disease cycles to improve future plantings. <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a> is another popular warm-season cover crop to grow in the vegetable garden. This variety works well in sandy soils or nutrient-poor soil types and is another cover crop that adds improved organic matter and suppresses weed pressures. There are several cool-season cover crops such as Broadleaf Mustard, Crimson Clover, Winter Rye, Hairy Vetch, Austrian Winter Pea, and Tillage Radish. The most popular cooler cover crops that we recommend are the Broadleaf Mustard, Crimson Clover, and Tillage Radish. The <a href=\"/products/florida-broadleaf-mustard/\">Broadleaf Mustard</a> is the top crop to plant if you are needing to suppress nematode populations, weeds, and soil fungi problems in the vegetable garden. It contains a chemical compound known as glucosinolate, which helps eliminate many common pests and diseases. While the <a href=\"/products/crimson-clover/\">Crimson Clover</a> does better at adding the soil nutrients back into the garden soil. The best time to incorporate clover in the garden before you plant heavy feeder crops such as corn, okra, or peppers. Lastly, the <a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\">Tillage Radish</a> contains long slender roots that will penetrate the hardest garden soils allowing for increased aeration and soil drainage within the vegetable garden. Another benefit of the longer roots is this cover crop can absorb nutrients from the deeper soil layers in the garden.\n<h2>Planting Cover Crops</h2>\nThe best time to plant warm-season cover crops is during the spring and fall plantings. While the cooler-season cover crops do best when planted in the fall and left to \"overwinter\" throughout the cooler months in the vegetable garden. When planting cover crop varieties we suggest either broadcasting or using our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. The most important aspect to understand when growing cover crops is they must be mowed down or cut before they go to seed in the garden. This will eliminate reseeding problems in the future growing seasons. Greg likes to use a flail mower to cut the cover crops and incorporate them back into the garden soil. The green manure that is left in the garden is great because in the south we struggle with organic matter because the temperatures during the hotter months tend to burn it up.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsbRrdnqFB8&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=47&amp;t=45s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Planting &amp; Growing Field Corn</h2>\nThe best time to plant field corn is during the spring and can be grown throughout the warmer months up until fall. We recommend planting field corn using our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> to provide accurate spacing in the vegetable garden. We also suggest using <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">drip tape irrigation</a> because corn is a heavy feeder and requires plenty of water and fertilizer for growth. When growing corn it is best to avoid overhead watering because the plants grow so tall that the irrigation will not reach the roots effectively in the garden. In order to lay drip tape quick and easy, we prefer to use the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer attachment</a>. In the garden, we can succession plant field corn to get maximum productivity and save space. We can get two succession plantings of field corn when planting in early spring and late summer. The benefit of succession planting is we are able to extend harvest supplies throughout the growing seasons. Another key aspect of planting corn is instead of long rows, it should be planted in square plots or blocks. This ensures that corn gets the needed pollination it requires to develop quality ears of corn. Without pollination, the tassels and silks will have poor germination and have trouble producing kernels on the ears. Planting in square plots also allows for better crop rotation of plants in the vegetable garden. Crop rotation is important because not only are you avoiding planting the same crop year after year but you are able to replenish the soil with the nutrients that different vegetables need in order to grow in the garden.\n<h2>Own Corn Meal and Grits</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg and Travis are showing how to make your own corn meal and grits from corn grown in the vegetable garden. This year, Greg grew the Bloody Butcher variety of field corn which is similar to the <a href=\"/products/jimmy-red-corn/\">Jimmy Red</a> variety. In order to shell the corn, Greg is using a sheller that he found at a flea market several years ago. Before making our own corn meal and grits, we place the corn in the freezer in order to kill off any weevil eggs. Then, we take the corn out of the freezer to grind it and then make corn meal and grits. When you grind it the meal will turn out a white type of meal but with red specks in it. Travis grew the <a href=\"/products/truckers-favorite-yellow-corn/\">Truckers Favorite Yellow Corn</a> variety in the vegetable garden. He also plans to make corn meal and grits out of his variety he planted in the garden as well.\n<h2>Field Corn Varieties</h2>\nAlong with the Bloody Butcher and Truckers Favorite, there are a couple of different field corn varieties that also work great for making your own corn meal and grits. The most popular variety of field corn is the <a href=\"/products/hickory-king-white-corn/\">Hickory King White Corn</a>. This variety has been around for several years, producing 12 to 13-inch tall plants and two larger ears per plant reaching around 9 to 10 inches in length. The <a href=\"/products/blue-hopi-corn/\">Blue Hopi Corn</a> is a variety that produces unique deep royal blue ears in the vegetable garden. This heirloom variety has an excellent flavor and texture profile making it great for homemade corn chips, cornbread, and tortillas. The <a href=\"/products/wapsie-valley-corn/\">Wapsie Valley</a> is an heirloom variety that contains bicolor ears such as copper red and yellow kernels. When ground the corn meal has a yellow tent with red flakes. It is a variety that is highly adaptable to several weather conditions and produces well-formed ears of corn in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odnev805thI&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=48&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:54-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Summertime Problems</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis describes the top vegetables to grow during the warmer summertime growing season. During the summertime, the weather conditions are not ideal to grow many vegetable varieties in the garden. Along with the harsh weather conditions, pest and disease pressures are unbearable to manage as well. Therefore, growing healthy and productive vegetables is completely impossible due to the heat and humidity that causes an increase in pest and disease pressures. Some vegetables that you should definitely avoid growing during the summertime include cucumbers, squash, zucchinis, peas, and tomatoes.\n<h2>The Top Vegetables to Grow</h2>\nOne of the top vegetables to grow during the summertime heat is sweet potatoes. When the vines are full they create a great foliage canopy that keeps the weed pressure down in the garden. Another great crop to grow during the heat is okra. Some okra varieties that we have available are <a href=\"/products/star-of-david-okra/\">Star of David</a>, <a href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\">Jambalaya</a>, <a href=\"/products/silver-queen-okra/\">Silver Queen</a>, <a href=\"/products/red-burgundy-okra/\">Red Burgundy</a>, and <a href=\"/products/cowhorn-okra/\">Cowhorn</a>. When growing okra, we suggest succession planting throughout the spring, summer, and fall to get maximum productivity. The third vegetable to grow during the summer months is eggplants. We have four different varieties of eggplants such as <a href=\"/products/nadia-eggplant/\">Nadia</a>, <a href=\"/products/nubia-eggplant/\">Nubia</a>, <a href=\"/products/purple-shine-eggplant/\">Purple Shine</a>, and <a href=\"/products/white-star-eggplant/\">White Star</a>. The last vegetable, Travis mentions has ideal to grow during the warmer growing season is peppers. We carry several pepper varieties that are all productive and contain excellent taste profiles. Some of these varieties include <a href=\"/products/beaver-dam-hot-pepper/\">Beaver Dam</a>, <a href=\"/products/anaheim-pepper/\">Anaheim</a>, <a href=\"/products/gold-rush-banana-pepper/\">Gold Rush Banana</a>, <a href=\"/products/bayonet-bell-pepper/\">Bayonet</a>, <a href=\"/products/jalapeno-pepper/\">Jalapeno</a>, and <a href=\"/products/aruba-cubanelle-pepper/\">Aruba Cubanelle</a> to name a few.\n<h2>Other Crops to Grow in the Summer</h2>\nFlower varieties such as Zinnias do wonders in the garden during the summer. We have several colorful varieties available such as <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-white-zinnia/\">White</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-lime-zinnia/\">Lime</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-orange-zinnia/\">Orange</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-scarlet-zinnia/\">Scarlet</a>, and <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-coral-zinnia/\">Coral</a>. The trick to growing zinnias is to prune once every two weeks in order to continue having beautiful blooms until the frost comes in the garden. The zinnias also attract beneficial insects that in return helps with pest control pressure. Another popular crop that we recommend growing during the summertime that will also benefit your garden soil is cover crops. The warmer season cover crops such as Buckwheat, Brown Top Millet, Sorghum Sudangrass, and Sunn Hemp are perfect to grow in the vegetable garden. The <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a> provides benefits to the garden such as weed suppression, increases soil drainage, and provides a significant amount of organic matter in the soil. Compared to other cover crop varieties, the buckwheat grows the fast which allows it to be incorporated back into the soil for quick turnover and replanting of vegetable crops. The next variety to plant if you have sandy loam soils is <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a>. This cover crop is best known as \"green manure\", this millet can improve soil tilth, water absorption, and soil quality. Another warm-season cover crop is the <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>, which creates a dense mat of vegetation within the vegetable garden. The sudangrass contains deeply penetrating roots that loosen the soil which provides an increase in aeration and soil drainage in the vegetable garden. The last cover crop that does best in the summertime is Sunn Hemp. The <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a> is another cover crop that provides weed suppression and an increase in organic matter. As well as, an increased supply of nitrogen into the soil which is beneficial when growing several vegetables during the fall, winter, and spring. All of these cover crops can be either broadcasted or planted with our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. Along with all the cover crops, they should be incorporated back into the soil before they go to seed in order to prevent any reseeding issues in the future growing seasons.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCuB7LLxPHk&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=49&amp;t=19s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:53-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Step by Step on Growing Okra</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is growing the easiest crops in the vegetable garden. Being apart of the Mallow family, okra is related to cotton or hibiscus and they all share similar flowers as well. It is pretty much a maintenance-free crop meaning it hardly needs any water or fertilizer to grow in the garden. The ultimate guide to growing okra is planting during the warmer weather months such as spring, summer, or fall. Travis mentions that okra does better when transplanted rather than direct-seeded. We recommend starting the transplants, 4 to 5 weeks prior to the desired planting date. You should start the okra transplants in the spring to ensure you get a headstart on the growing season. Since okra plants prefer warmer temperatures for seed germination, transplanting allows you to have them in the ground before the soil temperature warms up enough to direct seed. Okra plants require a soil temperature of at least 70 degrees to germinate in the garden. To effectively grow okra transplants we like to use our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays.</a> The seed trays contain internal vertical rooting training ribs that help aid in aeration and root ball drainage of the plants. This in returns allows for better transplants that experience less transplant shock and faster production. If you are direct seeding, you can use our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> to accurately plant without wasting seeds by overplanting. When planting okra, Travis likes to plant them on double rows to get the most production and save space in the garden area. Most okra plants should be harvested once they reach around 3 to 4 inches long in the vegetable garden. If you let them get longer than that they will begin to lose their eating quality and become tough. Okra pods usually need to be cut or picked at least once every other day in the vegetable garden. As the warmer growing season progresses the okra plants will get rather tall in the garden. Many of the old-timers believe in cropping the lateral stems which makes the plants taller and harder to harvest okra pods. However, we don't believe in cropping the lateral stems. Instead we believe that the more leaves the okra plants have, the more photosynthesis and fruit production can take place in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Most Popular Varieties</h2>\nIn the South, the ultimate guide to growing the most popular okra varieties is the Jambalaya, Red Burgundy, Clemson Spineless, and <a href=\"/products/cowhorn-okra/\">Cowhorn</a>. Out of those four varieties, Travis's favorite varieties to grow are Jambalaya and Red Burgundy. The ultimate guide to being the first one to harvest okra pods before anyone else is planting the best variety known as <a href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\">Jambalaya</a>. It is known for producing okra pods faster than any other variety in the vegetable garden. Therefore, they will produce pods when they reach about a foot tall which means it does require you to do some bending over to harvest them until the plants get taller. However, the <a href=\"/products/red-burgundy-okra/\">Red Burgundy</a> contains eye-catching deep red pods that make it more noticeable than traditional okra pods in a market farm setting. This variety has a little more slender pods than other okra varieties and works great for pickling, frying, or stewing in recipes around the homestead. The Clemson Spineless is more popular amongst the South Georgia farmers. It contains a rounded pod with no spines on the external layer. The heirloom variety, <a href=\"/products/cowhorn-okra/\">Cowhorn</a> allows you to grow a little longer pods before the okra loses the taste quality and becomes too tough.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBHEDC8x4YA&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=50&amp;t=14s",

It allows you to easily cut crops with one hand then harvest with the other hand. The harvesting bucket contains adjustable straps that won't cut into your skin and a padded area on the back for extra comfort. Another benefit of using this harvesting bucket is it has an 18-quart capacity and a kidney-shaped bucket to comfortably fit against your body. Overall, the best harvesting tool for picking crops such as okra, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, apples, etc., is the Over The Shoulder Harvesting Bucket.\n<h2>Other Harvesting Tools</h2>\nThe <a href=\"/products/garden-hod/\">garden hod</a> is a multifunctional harvesting bucket that makes harvesting fruits and vegetables quick and it allows you rinse them off all in one container. The heavy-duty mesh wire with weather-resistant wood will last for multiple harvestings in the vegetable garden.

    "body_html": "<h2>Best Tool for Harvesting Okra</h2>\nThe best tool for harvesting okra in the garden is our <a href=\"/products/handy-twine-knife/\">Handy Twine Knife</a>. This tool is a vinyl-coated ring that slides onto your finger that makes it easier to harvest vegetables and cut twine when using the trellising technique. When harvesting okra this twine knife can be worn either above or below the knuckle of your finger. It also comes with a protective sheath making it safer to store when not in use. The blade is fixed and only sharp on the inside making it safer to carry and use around the garden. The handy twine knife comes in five different colors that vary based on your finger size. There are five sizes ranging from 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14.\n<h2>Growing Okra in the Garden</h2>\nWhen planting okra the best time to plant is during the spring, summer, or fall months. Due to these plants loving the warmer weather temperatures they need to be planted in an area with plenty of sunlight. We recommend transplanting okra in the early spring to get a jumpstart on production and early germination of plants during the growing season. When transplanting using our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> this will ensure you develop a solid root ball because of the internal root training ribs that help the plants grow properly and reduce transplant shock when placed in the garden area. If you would rather direct seed okra plants the best time is either late spring or summer using our walk-behind <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. It comes with six adjustable seed plates that allow for a variety of different seeds to be planted in the seeder. Another benefit of growing okra is they work great for succession planting throughout the warmer months. When picked regularly you are able to get multiple harvests off one okra plant. The best time to harvest okra pods is when they reach around 3 to 5 inches in length. However, once okra plants get so tall they become less productive and harvesting will be more difficult. A major pest that can harm the growth of okra plants is root-knot nematodes. These nematodes cause knots on the roots of the plants that can drain the nutrients from the plants leaving them wilted in the garden. There are a couple of different ways to control these nematode problems in the garden area. We recommend using a cover crop like <a href=\"/products/broadleaf-mustard/\">Broadleaf Mustard</a> that will release chemicals to help suppress nematode, fungi, and insect populations and increase organic matter which will improve soil tilth and quality of the soil structure in the vegetable garden area.\n<h2>Okra Varieties</h2>\nThere are several different okra varieties that we have available that are not only productive but have excellent flavor profiles. The <a href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\">Jambalaya okra</a> is a hybrid variety that produces green pods that have heavy yields that are great for pickling, frying, or stewing. While the <a href=\"/products/red-burgundy-okra/\">Red Burgundy</a> is a highly-productive heirloom variety that has dark red pods that stay tender at longer pod lengths. Another heirloom variety is <a href=\"/products/cowhorn-okra/\">Cowhorn</a> which is an earlier producer that has long tender pods that reach up to 10 inches long. Unlike traditional varieties, the <a href=\"/products/silver-queen-okra/\">Silver Queen</a> variety has less ribbing which means the pods remain tender at 6 inches long. This variety also produces light green to almost white pods that make them unique from other okra varieties. The <a href=\"/products/star-of-david-okra/\">Star of David</a> produces shorter and thicker pods that are excellent for frying in the kitchen. It is another heirloom variety that got its name based on its origin in Isreal. All of these varieties work great when used for pickling, frying, stewing, or boiling in recipes on the homestead.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyEV1cPfGGw&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=52&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "How to Grow the Best Sweet Corn in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:52-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing the Best Sweet Corn</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is discussing all the essentials needed to grow the best sweet corn in the garden. The three most important factors when growing the best sweet corn are pollination, irrigation, and fertilization. When it comes to planting corn it should be planted in blocks or squares because corn is pollinated by the wind. Planting in blocks instead of long rows ensures that once the crop starts tasselling the wind can effectively pollinate the corn. Corn is a self-pollinating plant that produces a male flower, which is commonly referred to as a tassel, and a female flower, which is commonly referred to as the silks. In order for kernels of corn to be produced by the plant, the male flowers must pollinate the female flowers. The male flower is located at the very top of the plant whereas the female flower is formed along the stalk of the plant. The male flower contains the pollen, which is primarily spread by wind, that will be used to pollinate the female plant in the garden. Another major factor of growing sweet corn is it needs plenty of irrigation to grow in the garden. We recommend using drip tape because it ensures all the water is going directly to the plant roots where they need it the most to grow in the vegetable garden. Since corn is a heavy feeder it needs plenty of fertilizer to grow healthy plants. Before planting the corn, at pre-plant Greg likes to add a good amount of compost down in the garden. Then, once the corn gets around knee-high, he starts fertilizing with the fertilizer injector through the drip system. Greg recommends injecting <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> which is a water-soluble fertilizer through the injector. As well as, <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a> which is a 16% soluble nitrogen that is a great source for corn in the garden. When growing the best sweet corn these three important factors such as pollination, irrigation, and fertilization can all ensure that you produce the most productive and healthiest sweet corn in the vegetable garden all throughout the growing season.\n<h2>Sweet Corn Varieties</h2>\nThere are several different varieties of sweet corn that are all productive and have a great flavor profile. Greg's favorite variety is <a href=\"/products/silver-queen-sweet-corn/\">Silver Queen</a> which has been a popular old-fashioned sweet corn variety that has been grown in the vegetable garden for years. It usually grows 8 to 9 inches tall and produces ears that are 8 to 9 inches long. Another well-known variety is the <a href=\"/products/honey-select-sweet-corn/\">Honey Select Sweet Corn</a>. This variety is an All American Selections winner and is a sugary enhanced hybrid that has an excellent flavor profile. The sugary enhanced <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\">Peaches and Cream</a> variety contains bicolor ears that are white and yellow kernels that have two different flavor profiles. While the <a href=\"/products/stowells-evergreen-sweet-corn/\">Stowell's Evergreen</a> is an heirloom, open-pollinated variety that produces consistent 8-inch white kernels that have a great flavor profile and stores well after harvesting from the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a53Yt4vf0E4&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=53&amp;t=76s",

The major issue with weeds in the garden is they compete for nutrients, water, soil, and space against plants that strongly need it for growth. If the plants do not get all the necessary nutrients they need then the plants will not be productive and overall become unhealthy in the garden. Weeds can also become a hiding place for diseases and pests that will end up destroying plants from growing throughout the season. To maintain the pesky weed pressures from taking over the garden, we prefer to grow cover crops. The cover crops contain different traits that will help improve not only the garden soil structure and erosion control but it will also suppress weed and pest pressures. We recommend using cover crops such as <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a>, <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, and <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> for suppressing weeds in the vegetable garden. These cover crops are all warm-season crops so they work perfectly during the warmer months when it’s harder to grow other vegetables. We also like to use <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> in the garden to reduce weed pressures. When using drip tape we can accurately supply water to the plant roots directly and decrease unnecessary watering where plants do not need it like between rows and along the edge of the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Best Garden Hoe for Your Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is testing out the difference between a standard garden hoe and our push-pull hoe. In the garden, Travis has pigweed that has grown up pretty bad between his sunflower plants. In the South, pigweed is very prevalent and will grow in any kind of weather condition. The pigweed currently is about 8 to 12 inches tall and pretty thick in the garden. Travis is going to test which garden hoe is the best when it comes to removing the pigweed from the vegetable garden. With the traditional garden hoe, he has to lift the hoe and basically hack away at the ground. While this does works to displace the weeds, it also displaces a large amount of dirt that covers the weeds and we will end up having to come back in order to level the area out. However, with the <a href=\"/products/push-pull-hoe/\">push-pull hoe</a>, it stays almost level with the soil and all Travis has to do is slide it back and forth. This garden hoe provides a smoother and more effective way to remove pigweed from the vegetable garden. Then, we simply take that <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">dura rake</a> and clean the area of any leftover weeds.\n<h2>Push-Pull Hoe</h2>\nWith this v-shaped garden hoe, it allows for a quicker and more effective way to weed in the vegetable garden. The push-pull hoe contains a hardened steel blade that's sharp on all sides which allows you to cut the weeds in backward and forward directions. To effectively use the garden hoe, we push the hoe forward to cut the weed from the soil and backward to completely displace the entire weed in the vegetable garden. The push-pull hoe is perfect if you use drip irrigation because you can weed close to the lines without worrying about cutting into the drip tape. Overall, the push pull hoe is the best garden hoe because you can effectively get rid of all the weeds more fast and simple than a regular garden hoe.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ciZasSrqg&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=54&amp;t=18s",

    "title": "Planting Sweet Potatoes in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:48-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Grow Sweet Potatoes?</h2>\nThis warm-weather crop can be planted as late as July or August, but Travis is planting them in May this year because he wants to harvest them a little earlier in the garden. The sweet potatoes typically take around 100 days to harvest. There are several health benefits to growing sweet potatoes such as they provide a variety of vitamins and minerals. Once sweet potatoes are harvested they can be cooked and used in various recipes. When growing sweet potatoes, not only are they easy to grow, but they bring unique varieties to the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Planting Sweet Potatoes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is planting one of the easiest crops in the vegetable garden, In late February, Travis planted red potatoes and the Blue Belle variety in the garden. Since regular potatoes are in the nightshade family and sweet potatoes are in the morning glory family they can be planted directly behind each other in the same spot. When planting regulars potatoes, we should wait till the little buds grow off then cut the potato into pieces and plant those pieces. However, with planting sweet potatoes, we aren't planting the actual potato we are planting what is known as slips. When you leave the sweet potato out long enough it will begin to grow shoots off of it kind of like the regular potato with buds. With the sweet potato slips, you simply pluck them off the potato put them in water and they will start to develop roots when placed in the vegetable garden. Travis's favorite company to get sweet potato slips from is <a href=\"https://www.sweetpotatoplant.com/\">Steele Plant Company</a> in Gleason, TN. The two varieties he is going to plant this year are Covington and Centennial. When preparing the garden for planting sweet potatoes, at Hoss Tools we strongly believe in the fad system which stands for furrow, amend, and drip. So first we create a furrow along the garden row using the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a>. Next, Travis will take his good compost and amend the furrow that he just created. Then, he will add the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> system to ensure we get an accurate amount of irrigation directly to the plant roots. When placing the drip tape in the garden for sweet potatoes you can simply lay it to the side of the plants until we hill the potatoes. The sweet potatoes will be planted on three-foot row spacing in the vegetable garden. Due to our drip tape having emitters on 12-inch spacing this allows us to dictate where to place the sweet potato slips. Since sweet potatoes are vining plants they will grow vines on both sides of the row. To control the vines, Travis likes to take the <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">dura rake</a> and rake the vines back into the plants along the row. This will help create a dense foliage canopy that reduces weed pressures and allows a clear path to walk down the middles of the garden area. Once the sweet potatoes are fully mature, you can simply dig them out of the ground like regular potatoes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFdJdw_apIE&amp;t=27s",

    "title": "Organic Disease Controls in the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:48-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Organic Disease Controls?</h2>\nWhen growing your own food in the garden the overall goal is to produce the healthiest vegetables. In order to achieve this goal using organic disease controls and pest controls help eliminate applying harmful products on our vegetable garden area. To produce the healthiest vegetables, we need a garden that is not overrun with weeds, diseases, and pests that develop major issues in the garden area. We use organic controls to help reduce these problems because we don't have to worry about harmful chemicals being applied to our vegetables and fruits in the garden. Having organic controls not only improves our environment and garden soils, but our food is being produced in the healthiest way possible for consumption.\n<h2>Fighting Off Disease Problems</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is discussing the organic disease controls to use in the vegetable garden. During late spring and early summer, we begin to start seeing many disease problems pop up in the garden area. For example, tomatoes can get early and late blight, squash is prone to powdery and downy mildew, and other vegetables are susceptible too. In order to reduce these disease problems, we start by using drip irrigation and rotating our crops around in the garden. When using <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">Drip Tape Irrigation</a> this allows us to feed the plant roots exactly where they need it the most. In return, this takes care of overhead watering on unnecessary areas and allows the water to be directly underneath the plant instead of leaving moisture on the leaf foliage for a prolonged time causing severe issues in the garden. It is also important to have a crop rotation schedule because you can never plant the same family of vegetables in the same plot for two consecutive years. This reduces soil-borne diseases from living in the same area year after year in the vegetable garden. As well as, a variety of organic disease controls can be used to eliminate these harmful diseases from causing serious damage in the garden. The first disease control Greg talks about is Liqui-Cop. The <a href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\">Liquid Copper Fungicide</a> is a conventional method that controls many diseases that attack fruits, citrus, vegetables, nuts, and ornamentals. This fungicide is weather-resistant and sticks to plant and woody surfaces once it dries which in return leaves long-lasting control in the vegetable garden. It can be used as both a foliar spray and dormant spray in the garden. If used as a dormant spray it can be mixed with <a href=\"/products/horticultural-oil/\">Horticultural Oil</a> to provide a good combination treatment on the plants. The next solution that he recommends is <a href=\"/products/bi-carb-fungicide/\">Bi-Carb</a> which is made from an active ingredient of potassium bicarbonate. The Bi-Carb fungicide works best for controlling powdery mildew on vegetables, roses, and fruit trees. The <a href=\"/products/complete-disease-control/\">Complete Disease Control</a> is a broader preventative that helps with bacterial and fungal plant diseases in the vegetable garden. When used as a foliar spray application it can control powerdy mildews, gray mold, leaf spots, anthracnose, and other above-ground plant parts in the garden. The last organic control, Greg talks about is the <a href=\"/products/fruit-tree-spray-plus/\">Fruit Tree Spray Plus</a>. This is an insecticide, fungicide, and miticide that contains neem oil which works perfectly as a contact for disease control. To get the best control this spray needs to be applied at the first sign of insect or mite issue in the garden. It works in controlling aphids, mites, fungus gnats, stink bugs, thrip, tomato hornworm, and many other insect pests. All of these organic disease controls are OMRI certified meaning they are organically produced. Every time you spray an insecticide be sure to mix in one of these disease solutions to help fight off all the pest and disease problems in the garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfUSzAiz3Q&amp;t=22s",

    "title": "Best Way to Grow the Healthiest Tomatoes",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:46-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing Tomatoes in the Garden</h2>\nWhen planting tomatoes they do best transplanted instead of direct-seeded in the vegetable garden. Transplants should be planted in the garden, 4 to 6 weeks before the intended outdoor planting date. If weather conditions are just right the tomato transplants can be planted directly into the garden. However, if the weather is still too cold, then transplants should be stepped up into larger pots to allow more room for tomato growth. Once tomato transplants are planted in the vegetable garden they will begin producing heavy yields of fruits quickly. Tomatoes also need a support system to help the fruits stay upright in the garden. Greg recommends using the Flordia Weave Trellis technique with <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">twine</a> and stakes to ensure the plants stay off the ground, reduce the possibility of diseases, and keeps the fruits clean in the vegetable garden. Another way to support the tomato plants is by using <a href=\"/products/tomato-cages/\">tomato cages</a> which help with taller plants that are much heavier in the vegetable garden. The trellising systems can also help when growing peppers and eggplants as well in the vegetable garden. Providing plenty of calcium to the root systems will also help reduce blossom end rot and produce the healthiest tomatoes. After harvesting, the best way to store the healthiest tomatoes is to place them underneath a barn or carport that has a well-shaded area with good airflow.\n<h2>Tomato Varieties</h2>\nSome of the heirloom variety of tomatoes we offer are <a href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\">Mortgage Lifter</a>, <a href=\"/products/jubilee-tomato/\">Jubilee</a>, <a href=\"/products/cherokee-purple-tomato/\">Cherokee Purple</a>, and <a href=\"/products/yellow-pear-tomato/\">Yellow Pear</a>. These heirloom varieties produce popular tomatoes that have the best flavor profiles and are a go-to for growing on any homestead. The hybrid variety of tomatoes we have available are <a href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\">Bella Rosa</a>, <a href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\">Brickyard</a>, <a href=\"/products/mountain-glory-tomato/\">Mountain Glory</a>, and <a href=\"/products/sun-gold-tomato/\">Sun Gold</a>. All of these hybrid varieties have excellent flavor profiles, disease-resistant characteristics, and maximum yields in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Avoiding Blossom End Rot on Tomatoes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg explains the best way to grow the healthiest tomatoes by eliminating blossom end rot in the vegetable garden. A major issue during the growing stages of tomatoes is blossom end rot which occurs typically when the plants are stressed due to a lack of calcium. Calcium is soluble which means it moves readily throughout the plants in the vegetable garden. It commonly leaves the tomatoes with brown and yellow water spots on the end or bottom of the fruit where the blossom once was. The lack of calcium can be caused by poorly drained soils that cannot apply calcium fast enough to the growing tomatoes. In order to prevent blossom end rot, Greg applies <a href=\"/products/pelletized-gypsum-soil-conditioner/\">pelletized gypsum soil conditioner</a> to get the calcium to the plants effectively. Greg simply takes the tomato plant out of the <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting tray</a> and adds 8 ounces (1 cup) of the soil conditioner to the bottom of the desired hole you are planting the tomato transplant. He also mixes the pelletized gypsum in with the garden soil, then plants the tomato deep in the vegetable garden. It's important to add the calcium to the roots of the tomato plants in order to fight off the blossom end rot. Once the tomatoes start blooming, Greg recommends applying two more cups of the gypsum soil conditioner around the top of the plants and really close to the root system. When the water hits the tops of the plant it will move the calcium we applied into the soil and the plant roots will absorb it up to develop the fruits. Overall, avoiding blossom end rot problems will allow you to grow the healthiest tomatoes in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxk_xJvPmvA&amp;t=33s",

    "title": "Best Way to Fertilize Corn in the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:46-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing and Fertilizing Corn</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is discussing the best way to fertilize corn in the vegetable garden. When planting corn in the garden it is known to be a heavy-feeder that needs lots of water and fertilizer in order to produce healthy plants. Earlier in the Spring, Travis planted <a href=\"/products/truckers-favorite-yellow-corn/\">Truckers Favorite Yellow Corn</a> in the garden using the Hoss Garden Seeder. The best tool for planting seeds in the garden is our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> because it has six different modified seed plates that are adjustable for a variety of seed sizes. Since corn is a heavy-feeder, Travis highly recommends burying <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a> to feed the plant roots effectively all throughout the growing season. There are two different ways to fertilize corn in the garden such as side-dressing or with a fertilizer injector. Side-dressing means you make a furrow down the side or along the row and put granular fertilizer in the furrow. Then, once water enters the soil it leaches the fertilizer and makes it available to the plants in the garden. However, the best way to fertilize corn according to Travis is using the <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo fertilizer injector</a> and the drip irrigation system. It can be hooked up to any of your water sources such as a water hose or faucet and quickly adds fertilizer to your vegetable garden. The EZ-Flo works with any kind of water-soluble fertilizer like <a href=\"/products/liqui-fish-garden-fertilizer/\">fish emulsion</a>, <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean nitrate</a>, <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a>, and many others. Travis demonstrates using the 20-20-20 fertilizer which is made up of 20% nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. To set up the fertilizer injector you simply attach it to either a water hose, water faucet, or drip irrigation system. Then, you have a line going in and out of the tank that pumps water into and out of the tank. This also pumps the fertilizer out of the tank into your drip tape or another water system you're using. The fertilizer injector has four different ratio settings that determine the pressure that the fertilizer is coming out in the garden. Travis prefers to use the fast setting because it takes about two hours to empty all the fertilizer in the injector tank. He usually adds anywhere from two to four cups of the 20-20-20, then dissolve it in a large container, and add it to the fertilizer injector. Overall, the fertilizer injector makes it quick and easy to apply the accurate amount of fertilizer to the garden area. Keep in mind when growing different corn varieties they can all be succession planted meaning you can get two plantings in the garden. Also, when planting corn to get better production it should be planted in a square plot instead of long rows in order to increase pollination purposes. During the warmer months, if you experience corn ear worm pressures, apply <a href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\">Spinosad Garden Insect Spray</a> to the silks and tassels to help reduce further problems in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Heirloom &amp; Hybrid Corn Varieties</h2>\nThere are several different varieties of corn that we have available at Hoss Tools. We offer older heirloom varieties such as <a href=\"/products/jimmy-red-corn/\">Jimmy Red</a>, <a href=\"/products/silver-queen-sweet-corn/\">Silver Queen</a>, <a href=\"/products/hickory-king-white-corn/\">Hickory King</a>, Truckers Favorite, <a href=\"/products/stowells-evergreen-sweet-corn/\">Stowell's Evergreen</a>, <a href=\"/products/wapsie-valley-corn/\">Wapsi Valley</a> and <a href=\"/products/blue-hopi-corn/\">Blue Hopi</a>. These varieties typically are known to be a favorite to many for there excellent flavor profiles and are used as a staple ingredient when cooking a variety of recipes on the homestead. The hybrid varieties of corn include <a href=\"/products/ambrosia-sweet-corn/\">Ambrosia</a>, <a href=\"/products/honey-select-sweet-corn/\">Honey Select</a>, <a href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\">Incredible</a>, and <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\">Peaches and Cream</a>. These varieties tend to have excellent flavor profile, disease/pest resistant characteristics and have more production than heirloom varieties in the vegetable garden. Depending on your preference between heirloom or hybrid varieties they both offer great benefits in the garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FbeXJNmfQI&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=58&amp;t=33s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:46-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Growing Asparagus</h2>\nThere are a couple of different health benefits to growing asparagus in the vegetable garden. Like other vegetables, asparagus provides nutrients such as protein, fiber, potassium, phosphorus, folate, and a few other vitamins. As well as, a good source of antioxidants which helps protect cells from oxidative stress and free radicals. Another health benefit of asparagus is it can improve digestive health in the body. Also, helps reduce blood pressure which is a major risk factor for multiple people in the world. There has been several kinds of research done that suggest that increasing potassium intake and reducing salt intake is an effective way to lower high blood pressure.\n<h2>Planting &amp; Harvesting Asparagus</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg demonstrates the best way to harvest asparagus in the vegetable garden. When growing asparagus they do best when grown in lighter soils that warm up quickly and drains well in the springtime. It typically takes around three years for asparagus to get established well and have full production in the vegetable garden. However, if you maintain the garden beds that they are growing in you can easily get 10 to 15 years of good asparagus production. To prepare an asparagus bed, you should get rid of grasses and weeds to eliminate weed competition from the garden spot. To maintain asparagus beds, you simply cut them back to the ground during the wintertime, apply good compost, and then add wheat straw on top. Greg mentions that we add wheat straw to help insulate the bed and control weeds in the asparagus bed. In the springtime, when harvesting asparagus spears they start coming up through the wheat straw in the bed, Greg likes to take his <a href=\"/products/asparagus-knife/\">asparagus knife</a> and cut it right below ground level. When using the asparagus knife, you simply take the v-shaped blade and push it against the asparagus stalks for a quick and easy harvest. After harvesting asparagus, the best way to store asparagus is by placing them in the refrigerator in a sealed bag. Asparagus should only be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.\n<h2>Cooking with Asparagus</h2>\nWhen cooking asparagus, most people prefer to either grill, roast, or eat it raw from the garden. It is great vegetable to incorporate into salads, soups, or as a dip. Whether you are sauteing or eating asparagus raw it is vegetable that has many health benefits to offer and easy to grow in your garden area.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pOsjaV7wr0k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=59&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:44-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Organic Pest Control</h2>\nWhen using organic pest control the most important step in eliminating the pest problems is to be proactive in the garden. Greg recommends having a spray program early on to ensure that you reduce the pest issues before they over populate the vegetable garden. The benefits of using organic pest controls include an overall better garden area and harder resistance for pests. Every gardener desire is to have a better garden area for planting when using natural pest controls you reduce the risk of damaging the garden soils. Also, pests have a harder time resisting the organic pest controls because these sprays are developed with biological chemicals or traits rather than artificial which makes the insects less resistance to them in the garden. Another benefit of using natural pest controls is the ability to produce healthier vegetables. When growing your own food the overall goal is to create healthier food and apply the best natural products effectively in the garden. By using natural products we don't have to worry about our vegetables being sprayed with harsh chemicals and unsafe to consume. Overall, having healthier sprays being applied to the plants can in return allow for better vegetables to be produced and consumed from the garden.\n<h2>Varieties of Organic Pest Controls</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg explains the best organic pest control to use in the vegetable garden. One way that Greg likes to use pest control is with a combination of Neem Oil, Take-Down, and B.t. The organic pest control, <a href=\"/products/neem-oil/\">Neem Oil</a> is naturally derived from the Neem tree and be used on a variety of pests such as aphids, whiteflies, beetles, spider mites, and a few other insect pests. Neem Oil can also be used to control fungal diseases like downy mildew, black spot, powdery mildew, tip blight, anthracnose, etc. The <a href=\"/products/take-down-garden-spray/\">Take-Down Garden Spray</a> is a combination of pyrethrin and canola oil which allows for a quick knockdown with residual control. Take-Down will eliminate pests such as aphids, caterpillars, thrips, whitefly, mites, leafhoppers, etc. The <a href=\"/products/monterey-b-t/\">Monterey B.t.</a> is a bacteria that worms ingest that ends up killing them internally. B.t. should be applied at the first sign of infestation and then repeated weekly to maintain pest control in the vegetable garden. To apply these pest controls in the garden, Greg mixes the B.t. in with Neem Oil and spray that seven days apart. Then, the next week he will spray Take-Down and Neem in the vegetable garden. Which allows you to eliminate all the pest problems you may be experiencing in the vegetable garden. All of these pest controls should be mixed with water in order to make them spray. For the Neem Oil, Greg mixes one ounce per gallon and the Take-Down mixes one to two ounces per gallon. No matter what organic pest control products you decide to use in the vegetable garden, make sure to apply a spray program to ultimately eliminate insect populations from taking over the garden area.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md5xnlw6Y-o&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=60&amp;t=25s",

    "title": "Planting Double Rows of Blue Lake Beans",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:44-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing Blue Lake &amp; Green Crop Beans</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is planting two different varieties of beans on double rows in the vegetable garden. The first variety of bush bean is Blue Lake which is great for canning and eating fresh from the garden. The second variety is known as <a href=\"/products/green-crop-bush-bean/\">Green Crop Bush Bean</a> which contains a flattened appearance with heavy yields of stringless pods. The best time to plant beans is in the spring after the last frost date has occurred. Depending on the soil temperatures, seeds can typically germinate between 8 to 16 days. To get more production, beans can be succession planted every couple of weeks throughout the spring and early summer. Succession planting allows for a steady amount of production throughout the entire growing season and maximizes our space in a small garden area.\n<h2>Planting Double Rows</h2>\nPlanting on drip tape has many benefits for the garden area. A couple of these benefits is the reduction of soil erosion, improved plant health, less water waste, and saves time in the vegetable garden. Unlike overhead watering, drip tape penetrates directly to plant roots where the water and nutrients are needed the most which in return produces healthier plants. As well as, save water because you are not wasting water on unnecessary areas in the vegetable garden like the walkways where plants are not planted. Another benefit of drip irrigation is you are able to maintain weeds from taking over your entire garden area. To set up <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a> in the garden we recommend using our<a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\"> Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer Attachment</a>. This attachment makes laying drip tape easier and turns a two-person job into a one-person job. We also highly recommend burying drip tape to ensure the emitters stay upright and prevent animals from ruining the tape in the garden. To easily bury the drip tape, you can attach the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a> on the double wheel hoe to bury the drip tape and make furrows along the garden row. When planting on double rows, we place the drip tape buried in the middle of the crops to equally distribute water and fertilizer to plants. Planting on double rows allows us to maximize yield in the limited space we have in the garden area. We suggest planting double rows with 3-inch spacing and as close to 6 inches apart along the garden row. If you prefer single row spacing instead you can plant them with 2 to 3 inch spacing in the vegetable garden. Travis recommends direct seeding beans, but you can use the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> with the #6 seed plate adjusted to fit the seed size. When planting beans they should be planted thick along the garden row and thinned to the desired spacing.\n<h2>Other Bush Bean Varieties</h2>\nThe other bush bean variety we offer is known as the Provider. The <a href=\"/products/provider-bush-bean/\">Provider</a> variety has heavy-yields that can be planted earlier than traditional bush bean varieties. It makes uniform-sized pods that are normally 5 to 5 1/2 inches long and round. Unlike other bush bean varieties, this provider variety produces better in cooler soils and tends to continue production into the warmer months. This ensures that we have a longer harvesting window that maximizes production in the vegetable garden throughout the growing season as well. Another benefit of planting this provider variety is the disease tolerant characteristics it contains especially for downy mildew, powdery mildew, pod mottle virus, and common bean mosaic virus. Having a disease tolerant plant variety helps us control diseases/pests and allows us to have healthier plants in the vegetable garden. Overall, bush beans are\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99glPYJlWc8&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=61&amp;t=20s",

    "title": "Planting Bloody Butcher in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:43-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Bloody Butcher Corn</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is planting bloody butcher in the vegetable garden. Greg typically plants his corn with 36-inch spacing. However, in today's video, he narrowed it down to around 30 inches to get the most out of this rather expensive variety of corn. When planting corn varieties in the garden, you need drip tape irrigation to ensure the plants are getting all the water and nutrients that are needed for growth throughout the growing season. <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">Drip tape irrigation</a> works best when buried underneath the soil and plants. This ensures that several varieties of plants can get accurate amounts of water and fertilizer directly supplied to their plant roots for overall easier takeup. When planting bloody butcher and other corn varieties, they need plenty of room for growth and pollination. However, you also do not want to waste any room and plant them too far apart in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Jimmy Red Corn</h2>\nVery similar to the Bloody Butcher variety is our <a href=\"/products/jimmy-red-corn/\">Jimmy Red Corn</a>. This variety was originally cultivated by the Native Americans and has become a popular ingredient for grits, cornmeal, and cornbread. Similar to other field corn varieties, Jimmy Red contains a yellow color while in the milking stage but matures to a deeper red color. The Jimmy Red contains a flavor profile that has a rich sweet taste that has a gold standard for red corn. When planting the Jimmy Red variety we recommend using our walk-behind <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. The garden seeder comes with six adjustable seed plates that are made for a variety of crop seed sizes. Once plants start to emerge, Greg likes to go in the garden and thin plants to 8 to 12 inches depending on drip irrigation. Corn varieties should be planted in a square plot instead of long rows to improve pollination and better germination. The square plot allows for the plants to efficiently pollinate the silks and tassels that helps produce the kernels on each set of corn ear. Corn can be succession planted meaning we can get two plantings, one in early spring and one in late summer/early fall. During the warmer months, using Spinosad on the silks and tassels will help control the corn ear worm pressures in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Other Field Corn Varieties</h2>\nAlong with planting Bloody Butcher and Jimmy Red, Greg likes to plant other field corn varieties like Hickory King, Silver Queen, Truckers Favorite, and Wapsie Valley. The largest field corn variety is the <a href=\"/products/hickory-king-white-corn/\">Hickory King</a> that produces up to 12 to 13-inches tall and two large ears on each plant that are around 9 to 10 inches in length. Although, the <a href=\"/products/silver-queen-sweet-corn/\">Silver Queen</a> is the most popular field corn variety to plant in the vegetable garden for many years. This standard (su) variety contains a sugary gene that is responsible for the sweetness and creamy texture of the kernels on the corn. The <a href=\"/products/truckers-favorite-yellow-corn/\">Truckers Favorite</a> is another popular variety that produces 9 to 10-inches tall that grows well in many climates, but especially warmer climates. This corn variety produces better in cooler soils, making it great for early plantings in the garden. Another open-pollinated variety is the <a href=\"/products/wapsie-valley-corn/\">Wapsie Valley</a> that produces kernels that are high in protein. This variety is highly adaptable to several growing conditions and has the ability to produce huge stalks with well-formed ears.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZZ1x_6E4Dw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=62&amp;t=1s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:42-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Field Corn</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is planting a popular variety of field corn in the vegetable garden. The best time to plant corn is during the warmer months up until the fall. When growing field corn it is nearly impossible without <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">drip tape irrigation</a>. Since field corn stalks grow tall in the garden the overhead irrigation will not water the roots as effectively as the drip tape. Using our <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer</a> attachment is the perfect tool for laying drip tape fast and effectively in the vegetable garden. With drip irrigation buried and compost laid down in the trenches, we are ready for planting field corn. The compost is used as a soil amendment in order to help develop the field corn in the vegetable garden. To begin planting the <a href=\"/products/truckers-favorite-yellow-corn/\">Truckers Favorite</a> field corn we recommend using our walk-behind <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. The garden seeder allows us to accurately plant without wasting any seeds by overplanting. Another benefit of using our garden seeder is the six seed plates that are modified for a variety of different seed sizes. The truckers favorite variety of field corn that Travis is planting works great with our #6 seed plate. The seed plate has four holes so around a four and a half-inch spacing will work great for the field corn. With the garden seeder depth adjusted to one inch, Travis can plant field corn directly on top of the drip tape without worrying about puncturing or cutting into the drip tape. During the warmer months, to avoid corn ear worm pressures we prefer to apply <a href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\">Spinosad Garden Insect Spray</a> to the silks and tassels to control these insect problems. The silks and tassels are important for pollination because they make the kernels on the corn produce. Without good pollination of plants, you cannot have a good harvest of field corn in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Succession Planting &amp; Squared Plots</h2>\nIt is recommended to succession plant field corn because you can maximize yields and utilize space in the garden area. With field corn, two succession plantings are available in the early spring and in late summer/early fall. This extends harvesting times for crops and allows for a constant supply to harvest in the garden. Instead of planting field corn in long rows along the garden area, they should be planted in square plots or subplots. The squared plot ensures pollination is happening for the silks and tassel to produce kernels on the cob. When growing field corn in long rows this will result in poor germination and absence of kernels on the cob from insufficient pollination. Another benefit of planting in square plots is the ability to incorporate crop rotation in the garden. Crop rotation is important for several crops because when planting in the same area year after year it can cause many problems in the vegetable garden. One issue of not rotating crops is the reduction of soil nutrients and causing crops to be less fertile. When planting the same crop in the same area every season it can cause the garden soil to be drained of the same nutrients needed for plant growth leaving the garden unable to supply nutrients and produce healthy plants. When alternating between different crops the supply of nutrients can be replenished based on the varieties of crops being grown in the area. Crop rotation helps establish improved soil stability by alternating between deep and shallow roots of different crops in the garden. Overall, good crop rotation can produce healthier plants and improve the maximum yield in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csOibYEZalM&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=63&amp;t=48s",

    "title": "Simplest Way to Plant Potatoes in the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:41-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Preparing Potatoes for Planting</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is planting potatoes in the garden area. This year, when planting potatoes he has a few different varieties from <a href=\"https://irisheyesgardenseeds.com/\">Irish Eyes Garden Seeds</a> to try out. The varieties we are going to try out in the garden are Jelly, Blue Belle, and Russian Banana. In order to plant potatoes, Travis recommends cutting the potatoes up to only one or two eyes on each piece to get more yield. Once you cut the potatoes up the skin needs time to heal before planting in the vegetable garden. This ensures that the potato pieces do not become susceptible to soil fungus and rot in the garden. The process that the potato goes through when healing is known as suberization. Travis typically lets the potato pieces sit and heal for around three days to a week before they are completely healed over. To help with the suberization process it is recommended to use Fir Bark which is a fine dust that helps speed up the healing of the potato pieces. Travis prefers to scatter the Fir Bark dust on the potatoes kind like battering something up to fry and then shake them around in the bucket.\n<h2>Planting Potatoes in the Garden</h2>\nTo prepare the vegetable garden, Travis used his <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\">cultivator teeth attachment</a> to break up the garden soil. Then, with the wheel hoe and the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a>, we can make a furrow to plant potatoes in. When the potatoes are placed along the garden row, we can adjust the plow set to fit on the outside of the wheel hoe to cover up or hill the potatoes in the vegetable garden. Since Travis has three different varieties to plant, he is planting one in each row. He is placing the rows about two and half feet apart in the vegetable garden. In order to get straight rows in the garden, Travis prefers to use stakes and string for each row. Once each row has a furrow ready we should add some soil amendments before we plant potatoes. Travis has some worm castings from a local dairy that he is going to line at the bottom each furrow in the vegetable garden. When the worm castings are added then we can add the potatoes on top and hill it over with the Double Wheel Hoe. To plant the potatoes, Travis is planting them with the eye facing upwards and around 6 to 8 inches apart down the row in the garden. The reason we place the eye upward ensures that the potato plant can sprout and form leaves once it grows out of the soil. Travis mentions that we should not have to add water until they sprout from the ground. Once they begin to sprout, that's when he recommends laying the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a> in the garden. After, laying the drip tape Travis will hill the potatoes again because they prefer a lot of soil on top of them.\n<h2>Potato Varieties</h2>\nThere are a few different potato varieties that we have available at Hoss. The first variety is known as <a href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\">Adirondack Blue</a> which contains a purple flesh potato that is rich in antioxidants. Usually taking around 85 days to mature this unique potato variety offers exceptional yields and excellent flavor. Another popular potato variety that provides the best flavor is the <a href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\">German Butterball</a>. This variety is a late-season plant meaning it takes between 110 to 135 days to mature in the vegetable garden. The <a href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\">Red Norland</a> is a newer variety that has disease resistant to scab, late blight, and potato virus. This is another variety that has great yield, storage, and flavor profile. The <a href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\">Yukon Gold</a> is another popular variety that has been a favorite for gardeners for many years. All of these varieties work great for roasting, frying, baking, mashing, and so much more.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLnaH71eF-0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=64&amp;t=20s",

    "title": "Why Adding Lime in the Vegetable Garden is Important",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:39-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Adding Lime in the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg explains the benefits of adding lime in the garden. The two different forms of lime are regular agricultural lime and pelletized lime. The major difference between the two forms is that the regular lime is a powder and the pelletized lime can be used in a spreader. The agricultural lime is nearly impossible to put out by hand. Therefore, when using lime in the small garden area the best solution is to use the <a href=\"/products/pelletized-lime/\">pelletized lime</a>. The pelletized lime provides a natural source of magnesium and calcium that improves soil health. The pelleted form of lime makes it easier to spread, dissolve quickly, and improve fertilizer effectiveness in the garden. Some crops such as corn, lettuce, cabbage, beans, peas, and other greens all do well in limed soil.\n<h2>When To Add Lime in the Vegetable Garden?</h2>\nBefore adding lime to the vegetable garden, you should first take a soil sample test to ensure that your garden area needs it. You can get soil sample bags from your local extension office and then send them off to labs to test your soils. Once you receive your soil sample results, then you are able to accurately apply the right amount of lime to the garden soil. Adding lime in the vegetable garden will raise your pH levels in the soil. Once you raise the pH levels it is even harder to bring them back down. If you apply too much pH in an area that does not need it, then other nutrients will become tied up and crops will not be able to grow healthy in the vegetable garden. The only way to lower the pH is by using elemental sulfur. The issue with using sulfur is it is soluble meaning it will have to be applied year after year in order to eventually bring the pH level back down. In order to ensure you have a nice and healthy garden area, make sure to do a soil sample before applying elements that will affect your nutrients that are needed for plant growth. Once you have applied the lime to the garden soil, you may see a difference in four weeks, but it will take around 6 to 12 months for it to completely dissolve in the soil.\n<h2>Taking A Soil Sample Test</h2>\nWhen taking a soil test they can provide accurate information on the garden soil nutrients. The best way to collect the soil for testing is to determine which area you plan on gardening. Then, you should take at least 8 or 10 different samples from each area to ensure you get accurate information about the area. The sampling depth depends on which plants you plan on growing but for gardens, we recommend getting a sample depth of 6 inches. Keep in mind that the soil sample test should be done well in advance of the desired planting season. This will ensure you have plenty of time to get the test information back and you can prepare adjustments to the soil before the growing season in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFZomPdJ_JY&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=65&amp;t=1s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:39-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Preparing the Garden Area</h2>\nTo begin planting pelleted carrots in the high tunnel greenhouse Greg must first prepare the garden area. The first step in preparing the garden for planting pelleted carrots is to use the <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\">Oscillating attachment</a> on the Wheel Hoe to work the garden soil. Then, after working the soil we laid out compost exactly where we are planning to plant in the greenhouse. Greg mentions that we do not add compost to the entire area because we want to avoid weeds growing up in the walkways and we save compost by only applying it where it is needed. Once we work the compost in the soil we are ready to add drip tape to the garden soil. Since we are planting the pelleted carrots in the high tunnel greenhouse the only way to provide irrigation to the roots is through drip tape. Drip irrigation allows for the plants to be fed with water directly to the plant roots where it is needed the most for growth and allows you to conserve water. Another benefit of using drip irrigation is it allows us to plant crops on a double row spacing. When planting on a double row spacing we can get more plants planted in a row and more production of crops available for harvesting.\n<h2>Setting Up Drip Irrigation</h2>\nGreg has the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation kit</a> which comes with a <a href=\"/products/filter-regulator-combo/\">filter regulator combo</a> that he is going to place in the middle of his five rows. It is highly recommended to place the regulator combo in the middle of your row in order to have an equal amount of volume and pressure coming out of either side. Then, he will take his <a href=\"/products/mainline-tee/\">mainline tee</a> and attach it to the brass fitting of the regulator combo in order to connect two separate lines of drip tape on either side. In the greenhouse, Greg has the rows spaced 4 feet apart and is going to use where he placed the compost as a line to lay the drip tape along the row. For root crops, like carrots, there is no need to make a furrow and bury the drip tape deeper in the area. Greg will just lay the drip tape using the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">drip tape layer attachment</a> right on top of the soil and mound up the soil with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plows attachment</a> behind it and cover it up just a little bit. Once the drip tape is laid in the rows we take our <a href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\">mainline tubing</a> and lay it along the border of the garden to feed the individual drip tape rows. We will also add our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-start/\">drip tape row starts</a> to the mainline tubing to connect the individual tape in the greenhouse.\n<h2>Planting Pelleted Carrots</h2>\nGreg is going to plant a couple of different varieties of pelleted carrots such as Purple Haze, Romance, and Rainbow. With pelleted seeds, we highly recommend using our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> to make planting quick and easy in the greenhouse. Since we are planting in the high tunnel greenhouse, Greg wants to plant the pelleted carrots thick and a little over 2 inches apart. Using the garden seeder allows us to customize the seed plates to fit the pelleted carrots perfectly for planting. Once the garden is prepared and the seed plates have been adjusted for the garden seeder we are able to plant the pelleted carrots in the greenhouse. When planting, Greg will plant the carrots around 5 to 6 inches away from the drip tape on each side. Overall, pelleted carrots are easy to grow and store well after harvesting from the garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRfLe0w89bc&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=66&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:39-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Keep Your Garden Clean and Healthy?</h2>\nIf you are not a big fan of planting in the garden year-round, we recommend keeping the garden area clean and healthy instead of letting it grow up with grass and weeds every year. If you allow the area to grow up with grass and weeds every year you will have a continuous battle of fighting them off once you are ready to plant. When planting in the fall there are several benefits such as warm soil temperatures, fewer pest pressures, and cooler air circulation. Another benefit behind maintaining the garden area is the decrease in weed germination. Weeds can become a serious issue if they remain in your garden soil so removing them quickly will help eliminate them populating and making a home in your vegetable garden. In order to keep your garden area clean and healthy all year-round, you should always be looking for ways to improve your soil. A good soil structure will help your garden remain manageable and reduce disease problems that you may experience during the growing seasons. Overall, keeping the garden clean and the soil healthy will allow for better vegetable production during all the future growing seasons.\n<h2>Three Methods for Maintaining the Fall Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains three methods to keep your garden clean and healthy for the growing season. The first method in keeping your garden clean and healthy is to grow fall vegetables. Many crops like cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce, and Brussel sprouts are wonderful to grow during the fall because we don't have to worry about bolting when temperatures become warmer. However, if you prefer to not grow a fall garden you can plant cover crops instead. Cover crops have many different benefits for the soil such as erosion control, weed suppression, pest management, and nitrogen fixer in the vegetable garden. The cover crops will help keep new weeds from germinating and cover the ground until you are ready to plant vegetables in that area. Depending on your location if you live in a more warmer climate you can plant cover crop varieties such as <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>, <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a>, or <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a>. While if you live in a cooler climate area you can plant varieties such as <a href=\"/products/crimson-clover/\">Crimson Clover</a>, <a href=\"/products/hairy-vetch/\">Hairy Vetch</a>, <a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\">Tillage Radish</a>, or <a href=\"/products/broadleaf-mustard/\">Broadleaf Mustard</a>. All of the cover crop varieties improve different characteristics so when choosing what to plant you can achieve different benefits depending on the variety you plan to plant in the vegetable garden. The third method for maintaining the garden area is to simply tarp the entire garden plot with our <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\">silage tarp</a>. The tarping method is used as a preparation technique to eliminate new weeds from obtaining sunlight which will cause dying off once they germinate in the vegetable garden. It also helps once you are ready to plant in the spring you are able to pull the silage tarp off and the area is ready for quick planting in the vegetable garden plot. Another benefit of using the silage tarp is it can be a great way to extinguish a cover crop and prepare a garden area. You can simply mow the cover crop and place the tarp over the garden plot. Then, after a couple of weeks, you are able to remove the tarp and clean the area off and start planting in the plot. The silage tarp allows for you to incorporate a no-till method meaning no gas-powered equipment is used in the vegetable garden. Overall, Travis plans to use all three methods during his fall garden season this year.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEhuAxqRshA",

    "body_html": "<h2>Why Grow Cauliflower in the Garden?</h2>\nCauliflower is one of Travis's favorite fall crops to grow due to three major benefits. The first benefit is the ability to succession plant it throughout the growing season. This means when growing cauliflower you can plant it at several different times throughout the fall and get multiple harvestings. The second benefit of growing cauliflower is the excellent storage it possesses. Unlike other crops, cauliflower can be stored for up to two weeks when stored properly after harvesting. The third reason is simply the taste profile that cauliflower obtains. When discussing the taste difference between store-bought and homegrown cauliflower, the best taste would be homegrown cauliflower. However, when growing cauliflower it is important to plant during accurate temperatures. During the growing stages of cauliflower if there is any type of stress they may experience a problem known as buttoning. Buttoning is a process that makes tiny button cauliflower heads which happens when temperatures are too cold or hot. The buttoning can also happen if cauliflower plants experience a drought or growing in poor soil conditions in the vegetable garden. Along with buttoning, cauliflower is susceptible to diseases such as downy mildew, black rot, and cabbage worms. To help fight off some of these pest and disease pressures we prefer to use our <a href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\">Spinosad Garden Insect Spray</a> to control these problems in the vegetable garden. Overall, growing cauliflower in the vegetable garden can lead to many health benefits. Cauliflower provides plenty of antioxidants such as Vitamin C and K which are needed to fight off inflammation in the human body.\n<h2>Growing Cauliflower</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks all about growing cauliflower in the vegetable garden. We recommend starting cauliflower transplants either in late summer or late August. Our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> work great for transplanting cauliflower due to the vertical root training ribs that allow for better root ball drainage and aeration. We recommend transplanting over direct seeding because you are able to achieve more consistent plant spacing and reduces disease pressures during the early growth stages. Three excellent varieties that Travis mentions is the Snow Bowl, Flame Star, and Graffiti. The <a href=\"/products/snow-bowl-cauliflower/\">Snow Bowl</a> variety is a white cauliflower that makes wrapper leaves which helps with keeping the crowns of cauliflower protected from the sunlight in the vegetable garden. The <a href=\"/products/flame-star-cauliflower/\">Flame Star</a> is a hybrid variety that produces orange/yellow heads of cauliflower. Since this variety produces a yellow cauliflower we do not have to worry about the sun bleaching the large heads. The snow bowl and flame star cauliflower are early maturing varieties that are ready for harvesting around 50 to 60 days. While the <a href=\"/products/graffiti-cauliflower/\">Graffiti Cauliflower</a> variety is heat tolerant and produces a darker purple color, unlike other traditional cauliflower varieties. The Graffiti variety takes a little longer to mature in the vegetable garden and is usually ready for harvest within 80 days. The best time to harvest cauliflower is when the heads reach around 5 to 6 inches in diameter. If the cauliflower crowns become too large the plant leaves are unable to wrap the crowns which can in return cause discoloration by the sun.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gYVweTyLWAE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:34-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>First Fall Crop of the Season</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the first fall crop he prefers to plant for the upcoming growing season. When preparing for the Fall garden, Travis recommends going ahead and planting a few crops right before the weather conditions start to break so we can get an early start on preparation for the season. The first fall crop he likes to plant is pole beans. When it comes to pole beans we offer a couple of different heirloom varieties such as Rattlesnake, Christmas Lima Beans, and Kentucky Wonder. The <a href=\"/products/rattlesnake-pole-bean/\">Rattlesnake Pole Bean</a> is an older heirloom variety that has plants growing up to 10 inches when trellised which allows them to produce around 6 to 7-inch pods that can be harvested frequently during the growing season. Then, the <a href=\"/products/christmas-lima-pole-bean/\">Christmas Lima Beans</a> are a heat-tolerant variety that contains a nuttier flavor profile than traditional lima beans. This lima bean variety has a dark red and white exterior appearance. While the <a href=\"/products/kentucky-wonder-pole-bean/\">Kentucky Wonder Pole Beans</a> are an open-pollinated variety that produces long green pods. The Kentucky Wonder variety has heavy yields of 9 inch straight pods that have a climbing growth habit in the vegetable garden. Pole beans do not like hot temperatures, so we go like to go ahead and plant them during late August in order to allow 50 days of maturity which will leave them ready to harvest during early October when temperatures are cooler. Planting pole beans for early preparation of the fall growing season allows us to harvest when we know weather conditions are going to be just right.\n<h2>Growing &amp; Harvesting Pole Beans</h2>\nSince pole beans are climbing plants we will need to add a trellising system in order to provide support for growth in the vegetable garden. Travis currently has a 60-foot long plot with T-post every 10 feet along the garden row. This allows him to establish a Hortonova trellis for his pole beans to grow on in the garden. When setting up the Hortonova trellis, we cut it to the length of the garden row then tie it to the T-post and secure it with zip ties. Then, Travis takes the end of his garden rake handle and simply punches a hole in the soil every 3 to 4 inches underneath the trellis for planting pole bean seeds. Since we are growing pole beans on a trellis vertically we can plant them pretty close together in the vegetable garden. When direct seeding you can use our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> with the #6 seed plate to accurately plant in the garden. This is a versatile garden planter tool that has modified seed plates that allow you to plant a variety of different seed size variations in the garden. We recommend planting pole beans on either side of the trellis to maximum the amount of production and save space when you are harvesting in the garden area. After adding the trellising system and the holes in the soil we can drop one seed per hole. Once the seeds are in the holes we can use our <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">garden rake</a> to cover the seeds and pack the area with soil. Starting in early October, we should start to see pole beans producing all along the trellis system until the end of November when we experience our first frost. Pole beans are ready to harvest after one or two weeks of flowering. They need frequent harvesting in order to continue production of pole beans throughout the growing season. In order to avoid disease and pest pressures having good crop rotation and insecticides can help these reduce these issues from developing in the vegetable garden.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIkfw3lwewE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;t=8s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:34-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why add Compost to the Vegetable Garden?</h2>\n<p>There are many beneficial benefits when it comes to adding compost to the plants growing in the vegetable garden. The major reason for adding good compost to the vegetable garden is to improve our soil structures with nutrients. When we increase the nutrients we are able to improve the ability to hold nutrients within the soil for plants to grow. During the decomposition process, organisms are broken down into microorganisms and macroorganisms which are essential for healthy soils. The compost will add properties such as potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other elements that are very important for plant health. Another benefit that compost adds to the vegetable garden is the reduction of soil erosion. When dealing with compost it loosens properties in soil structures like clay or silt in order to spread plant roots. This will in return improve the soil structure to retain water and provide a healthier root system. Along with good compost comes good soil microbes that help fight off diseases in the vegetable garden. The soil microbes will prevent issues with root rot and other diseases that can affect your garden in the future.</p>\n<h2>Avoiding Contaminated Compost</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Greg explains ways to avoid contaminated compost from entering into the garden. When talking about whether to use manure, wheat straw, or regular straw in the garden in the past that was the most common composting methods. However, now we have herbicides that have evolved and developed that have more contaminated properties that are being used in the vegetable garden and around the homestead. The two herbicides that cause problems in the compost and manures nowadays is Clopyralid and Picloram. For example, Clopyralid is used primarily in the turfgrass industry to kill weeds. However, those clippings that were contaminated with Clopyralid properties can be carried out in the compost and eventually end up in our vegetable garden. While Picloram is used mainly as a herbicide in pastures and hayfields to kill off broadleaf weeds and keep the fields weed-free. Those can also be carried over because if you buy hay from a farmer that has sprayed Picloram on his field and you have livestock that consumes that hay. In return, you will receive that manure from the livestock to supply nutrients to your garden and you will end up with contaminated compost in the vegetable garden which will cause a serious problem during future growing seasons. The problems you will begin to see in your garden if the plants get affected by these contaminated compost is known as the cupping effect. This cupping effect will cause your leaves to form upwards which will in return wither away, die off, and not produce. Some crops like tomatoes, peppers, and several others are extremely sensitive to these contaminated properties if released in the vegetable garden. Overall, to avoid spreading contaminated compost in the vegetable garden make sure they are free of any harsh chemicals.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lffNPpkeZE?si=OCl5B8mohnkxnm-w\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "title": "Growing Elephant Garlic in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:34-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What is Elephant Garlic?</h2>\nClosely related to leeks, elephant garlic has a couple of similarities and differences when compared to regular garlic. Similar to leeks in appearance it contains a tall flowering stalk with flat leaves but has a bulb that forms large garlic-like cloves. Much like onions, the immature elephant garlic plants can be topped off or cut off in order for more plant energy to focus on the bulbs. However, the flavor profile of elephant garlic is much more similar to regular garlic than leeks. The elephant garlic contains a milder flavor than garlic and can sometimes taste better when used raw in salads and other dishes.\n<h2>Growing Elephant Garlic</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg is explaining how to grow elephant garlic in the vegetable garden. In the South, we struggle with growing garlic because of our harsh weather temperatures. Due to these temperatures, we have better success growing elephant garlic in the vegetable garden. We recommend planting onions about 4 to 6 inches deep and around 16 inches apart between rows. This allows for plenty of space to easily manage weeds in between the rows using our <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single</a> or Double Wheel Hoe. It is important to manage the weeds in the garden because they will compete with the elephant garlic roots for nutrients in the soil that is needed for growth. Greg is going to plant his elephant garlic on 22-inch rows using his <a href=\"/products/row-maker/\">row maker</a>. Once the rows are marked off, he will take his <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a> and make furrows to plant the elephant garlic. When planting elephant garlic he will space them about 8 to 12 inches apart and they should always be planted with the blunt end down and the pointy end in the upright position in the vegetable garden. After all the elephant garlic has been planted in the furrows, Greg takes the Double Wheel Hoe with the plow attachment in the hilling position and covers them up along the vegetable garden. The elephant garlic will take around 90 days before it is mature and ready to harvest in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Harvesting Elephant Garlic</h2>\nWhen it comes time to harvest elephant garlic you are able to get a one time harvest in the vegetable garden. The elephant garlic is normally twice the size of regular garlic when it comes time to harvest in the garden. Once the bulbs on the leaves begin to die back and bend over that is a key indication that the elephant garlic is ready for harvest in the vegetable garden. After harvesting all the elephant garlic from the garden they should be stored away to cure in an area that is shaded and dry like underneath a barn. To maintain the best storage life and flavor profile, elephant garlic should be kept in a cool area with no sunlight until ready to be used for cooking. Elephant garlic has a shorter storage life than traditional garlic so it should be used within a couple of weeks for optimal flavor. Along with storing away elephant garlic, we are able to save cloves for the next growing season in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VonJy4DLLE&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=68&amp;t=29s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:32-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Summer Squash Varieties</h2>\nA popular crop to grow in the vegetable garden for many years is varieties of summer squash. Some of our most popular summer squash crops include our patty-pan squash varieties known as Sunburst and Bennings Green Tint. The <a href=\"/products/sunburst-squash/\">Sunburst</a> variety is a hybrid that produces a great yield of fruits that are bright yellow with small green rings around the center. As an All American Selections winner, Sunburst has more of a nuttier flavor profile compared to other summer squash varieties. The <a href=\"/products/bennings-green-tint-squash/\">Bennings Green Tint</a> is an heirloom variety that is also very productive and is highly credited for being the best tasting summer squash variety. Another popular variety is the hybrid, Goldprize Squash. This squash is a straightneck variety that is highly productive in the vegetable garden. The goldprize variety contains an excellent disease package that is resistant to several common mosaic viruses. Also, the Eight Ball variety produces perfectly round fruits with an excellent nutty flavor and firm texture. Along with our various squash varieties, we offer Golden Delight Zucchini and Spineless Beauty Zucchini. The <a href=\"/products/golden-delight-zucchini/\">Golden Delight Zucchini</a> is another hybrid variety that contains an excellent disease package and maximum productivity with plant longevity. While the <a href=\"/products/spineless-beauty-zucchini/\">Spineless Beauty Zucchini</a> is known for its spineless petioles that do not leave an itching sensation during and after harvesting in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Growing Summer Squash</h2>\nWhen growing summer squash in the vegetable garden you can either direct seed or transplant, but we highly recommend direct seeding squash varieties. Since squash varieties are susceptible to a couple of plant diseases like downy mildew and powdery mildew we suggest using <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a> to help control some of these disease pressures from causing issues in the vegetable garden. If you experience excessive heavy rainfall using our <a href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\">Liquid Copper</a> herbicide this will help reduce disease pressures and plant moisture buildup as well. When planting summer squash, we prefer to plant seeds every 12 inches along the garden row. After seeds start to emerge, we thin to one every 2 feet to establish plenty of room for plant growth. Once the summer squash is fully mature we can get multiple harvests throughout the growing season. To ensure fruits do not become too large or lose flavor we prefer to harvest every 2 or 3 days to collect all the mature fruits.\n<h2>Removing Summer Squash from the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis shares a couple of tips to know when you need to remove summer squash from the garden area. Around the middle of May, Travis planted a <a href=\"/products/goldprize-squash/\">Goldprize squash</a> variety that has been providing maximum production in the garden throughout the growing season. However, when the squash varieties start to get older they will start to decline in production and will begin to create problems in the garden if they are not removed. The decrease in production is the first indication that the squash is starting to become old plants in the garden. The second indication the plants are older is you will start to see an increase of diseases affecting the leaves on the plants. Squash bug eggs will develop on the leaves and pickle worms will start boring holes in the side of the fruits leaving them damaged. Leaving the summer squash in the garden will end up causing diseases like fungal spores to overwinter causing problems to develop in the future vegetable garden area. Overall, when summer squash is mature it is best to go ahead and harvest the varieties before they allow disease and pest pressures to take over your vegetable garden area causing several problems in the future.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn_1nZAqxNk&amp;t=62s",

    "title": "Downy Mildew Resistant Pumpkins in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:32-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Preparing the Garden for Planting</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is explaining how to plant downy mildew resistant pumpkins in the vegetable garden. In order to clean up the garden area from a previous harvest, Travis likes to use the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-sweeps-attachment/\">Sweeps</a> attachment. This makes uprooting larger weeds and cleaning everything out the garden quick and easy. Then, Travis took two posts and placed them at either end of the row and ran a string between them. He used this in order to make a straight row to create furrows where he planned to lay his <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">drip tape irrigation</a>. The pumpkins were planted on about 5-foot spacing to ensure they had enough room for the growth stages in the garden. After making the furrows, Travis added some good compost to lightly side dress the bottom of the trenches in order to give the plants a good amount of nutrients to start off within the vegetable garden. Once that is done, he uses his Double Wheel Hoe with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer Attachment</a> to lay the drip tape in the furrows he has created. As well as, add all the fittings he will need for the drip tape and check to make sure they are all working correctly in the vegetable garden. Once the furrows and drip tape has been layed and set up we are ready to plant downy mildew resistant pumpkins in the garden area.\n<h2>Importance of Drip Tape</h2>\nWhen planting crops such as pumpkins, drip tape irrigation is an important component for the success of planting and growing pumpkins in the South. Due to our weather conditions, we have several problems with downy mildew because of the humidity and moisture levels that we experience throughout our growing seasons. Since drip irrigation applies water effectively to plant roots and reduces moisture on leaves this is the perfect solution for decreasing downy mildew problems in the vegetable garden. Overall the benefits of having buried drip tape is the ability to conserve water, feed plants effectively, reduce disease pressures, and have a more manageable garden area.\n<h2>Downy Mildew Resistant Pumpkins</h2>\nIn the South, we benefit from planting downy mildew resistant pumpkins because we do not have to struggle with downy mildew pressures destroying our plants and we can overall get better production from within the garden area. The first downy mildew resistant variety is a pumpkin and butternut squash hybrid. This crossed variety is made between an heirloom <a href=\"/products/seminole-pumpkin/\">Seminole Pumpkin</a> that contains a resistance package and the <a href=\"/products/hoss-butternut-squash/\">Butternut Squash</a> which has the taste profile in order to get a good combination of the two to grow in the garden. The next downy mildew resistant variety is the Chinese Tropical Pumpkins which is similar in appearance to the <a href=\"/products/fairytale-pumpkin/\">Fairytale Pumpkins</a>. On the second row, Travis is planning to plant the Orange Bulldog Pumpkins which was a variety developed by the University of Georgia. When planting these varieties he is going to direct seed in two rows and plant them about a foot apart because that's how the emitters on the drip tape are spaced along the garden row. Once the seeds are placed on the drip tape emitters, Travis will simply take the <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">Dura Rake</a> and cover the seeds and pack them along the row in the garden area. After around 90 days the pumpkins are ready for harvest once the plants die back, fruits have reached full color, and the stems have hardened. If you struggle with growing pumpkins in the garden because of your weather conditions try giving these downy mildew resistant pumpkins a try during your next growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hbKSTtVGTQ&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=69&amp;t=20s",

In the spring, we recommend transplanting in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> that have internal vertical root training ribs in order to get a jumpstart on the growing season. This will allow for plants to go in the ground before the soil is warm enough for direct seeding in the vegetable garden. Since watermelons are susceptible to plant diseases if leaf moisture is present we prefer to use <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> to reduce these problems and feed the plants more effectively in the garden. If you have heavy amounts of rainfall using a fungicide like <a href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\">Liquid Copper</a> will help reduce disease pressures as well. Watermelons are ready to harvest when the tendril or curly Q which is located between the fruit stem and the fruit has completely dried up. The tendril is typically curly and green but will become dry when the fruits are ready for harvest in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Watermelon Varieties</h2>\nWhile there are several different varieties of watermelons in the world we carry some of the best that we have found to grow in the vegetable garden. Greg's favorite watermelon variety that he has grown in the vegetable garden is the Crimson Sweet. The <a href=\"/products/crimson-sweet-watermelon/\">Crimson Sweet</a> variety is known for its deep crimson flesh, high sugar content, and is an All American Selections winner. This is a seeded variety that tends to be a little larger than some of the other watermelon varieties that are grown in the vegetable garden today. Another popular variety that we carry is the <a href=\"/products/moon-and-stars-watermelon/\">Moon and Stars Watermelon</a>. This heirloom variety is known for its rather unique coloration pattern containing a dark green skin and yellow spots on the exterior of the watermelon which resembles moons and stars. Along with the Moon and Stars variety, we also carry a <a href=\"/products/yellow-moon-and-stars-watermelon/\">Yellow Moon and Stars Watermelon</a>. Similar to the traditional moon and stars watermelon exterior the Yellow Moon and Stars contains a yellowish-meat variation interior that has a sweet flavor profile. Two other excellent heirloom varieties we offer is the <a href=\"/products/georgia-rattlesnake-watermelon/\">Georgia Rattlesnake Watermelon</a> and <a href=\"/products/charleston-gray-watermelon/\">Charleston Gray Watermelon</a>.\n<h2>Tips for Ripe Watermelons</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Greg discusses how to determine when watermelons are ripe in the garden. Over the years there have been many different ways to tell when a watermelon is ripe such as how green the exterior is or how yellow the belly is. However, Greg is going to explain the easiest way to determine when watermelons are ripe. The best way to determine if the watermelons are ripe is by the sunspots on the watermelon exterior. When there a little sun exposure on the watermelons it can be a good indication that the watermelon is ripe. Along with this indicator, the curly Q that's attached where the stem meets the vine is completely dried up all the way to the back of the mainline stem. Greg shows an example of a watermelon that is almost ripe and we can tell this because the curly Q is dried up about halfway on towards the mainline stem. Along with another watermelon that is a few weeks off till becoming ripe. The easiest way to know if a watermelon is ripe is by checking the curly Q or tendril to determine if it is completely ripe and ready for harvest in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kjOnnhcLfs&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=70&amp;t=40s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Growing Cayenne Peppers</h2>\nThe best time to grow cayenne peppers is during the warmer months. The cayenne peppers are an heirloom variety that produces long slim deep red peppers with a hotter flavor profile. They are mostly used for hot sauce but can be prepared as red pepper flakes for pizza toppings or pasta dishes. When growing cayenne peppers we highly recommend growing them in the <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. The seed trays will allow for a jump start on planting which we allow for stronger and reduce disease pressures in the vegetable garden. If the plants are not ready to be planted in the vegetable garden they should be stepped up to a 4-inch pot to allow more room for growth. Since peppers are apart of the nightshade family they are susceptible to blossom end rot which can cause a calcium deficiency. To help reduce these problems you can apply <a href=\"/products/pelletized-gypsum-soil-conditioner/\">pelleted gypsum</a> at the base of the plant at bloom set. Pepper plants can produce 5 to 6 inch long fruits that reach around 2 to 3 inches tall. Since these plants produce heavy yields on each plant we recommend using the Florida Weave trellising technique that ensures plants and fruits have plenty of support and stay off the ground which will reduce soil-borne disease problems in the vegetable garden. The peppers will initially be green and should be left to mature to a deep red color for optimal flavor and heat profile. Overall, whether you like sweet or hot pepper varieties, growing them in the garden will leave you plenty of production to harvest and incorporate in many different recipes.\n<h2>Red Pepper Flakes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the best red pepper flake recipe to make at home. Travis currently has two rows of <a href=\"/products/long-slim-cayenne-pepper/\">Cayenne Peppers</a> growing in the vegetable garden. Most of them are starting to turn red which means they are ripe and ready for harvest. After harvesting all the red peppers from the garden, Travis takes them inside to wash them and then start the recipe. The first step is to cut the green stems off of them and place them in a bowl before you place them in the oven. If you prefer them to them be less hot you can remove the seeds, but Travis prefers to leave the seeds in there. The major key to dehydrating the red pepper flakes is with low and slow heat. You don't want to burn them just simply dry them out. The best way to dehydrate red peppers is with a food dehydrator but an oven works great also if you don't have a food dehydrator. With either a regular baking pan or an elevated pan you can lay the red peppers along the trays evenly. Then, once the peppers are on the trays we slide them into the oven and place the temperature as low as the oven will go. Travis recommends leaving them in the oven for around 8 to 10 hours so place them in the oven at night and get them out in the morning. After the cayenne peppers are done in the oven they turn out dry and crispy. Also, the red peppers have a smoky smell and they crumble up in our hands. Next, Travis is going to place them and the seeds all in the food processor to get them nice and ground up. Then, you simply can put the red pepper flakes in a mason jar and store away in the spice cabinet. The red pepper flakes will store for a while in a good storage area. This is the best and easiest red pepper flakes recipe that Travis has found to work really well for him.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUpaStRnNEI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:30-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Maintaining Weeds in the Garden</h2>\nNot only are weeds unattractive, but they steal nutrients and irrigation from the plants you are growing in the vegetable garden. This will cause issues with plants because they need all the available nutrients and irrigation they can get in order to grow in the garden area. Another issue with weeds in the garden is they can be a hiding spot for pests that are eating at your plants in the garden. In order to maintain the weed pressures in the garden, we recommend growing cover crops. Cover crops contain different traits that can help improve soil structure, erosion control, and suppress weed/pest pressures. Some cover crops that are great for suppressing weeds is <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a>, <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, and <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a>. These are all warm-season crops so they work perfectly in the garden during the warmer months when it's harder to grow other vegetables. We also prefer to use <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> in the garden to reduce weed pressures. Instead of overhead watering, we use drip tape to accurately supply water to the plant roots directly. This will decrease unnecessary watering where plants do not need it like between rows and along the edge of the garden area. To remove the weeds from within the rows and between plants we prefer to use our <a href=\"/products/push-pull-hoe/\">Push Pull Hoe</a>. The push pull allows you to effectively remove deeply rooted weeds close to the plants and drip tape irrigation without damaging the vegetable garden. To properly eliminate weed pressures in the garden using cover crops, drip irrigation, and proper tools will help destroy these damaging weeds from causing several problems in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Morning Glory Weed</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about the most dangerous weed in the vegetable garden. The invasive Morning Glory weed is a warm-season weed and typically develops during the harsh warmer months. When drip tape is buried in the garden, we can find this weed in between our plants because they prefer moist soil. The vining weed will crawl along the ground and strangle the plants by climbing all over them leaving many problems in the vegetable garden. If the morning glory weed is left to mature in the garden, it will start to produce funnel-shaped flowers which will eventually produce seeds. When these seeds produce they can persist for up to 20 years in the soil and will allow the morning glory to cause a dangerous weed problem in the garden for a long time. This dangerous weed can be found crawling all over your squash or okra plants. However, the worst place to obtain morning glory weed is in the sweet potato plants. Due to the morning glory weeds looking extremely similar to sweet potato leaves it can be difficult to determine the difference between the two in the vegetable garden. Travis explains a couple of easy ways to disguise between the two. The first difference between the sweet potato plants and the morning glory weed is the shape of the leaves. The sweet potato plant has little incisions along the side of the leaf. While the morning glory weed is smooth around the leaf. Another indicator is morning glory weed is not as thick as the sweet potato stem in the vegetable garden. So the sweet potato stems are going to be thicker and more robust than the weed stem. Overall, if you see more of a rounded leaf and thin stems you can determine that it is apart of the morning glory weed and it needs to be removed from the garden before it causes serious problems.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Islp4tJXXps\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;t=102s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:30-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Monoecious vs. Gynoecious Cucumbers</h2>\nThere are many differences when it comes to monoecious and gynoecious cucumber varieties. Monoecious means there is more production of male flowers than female flowers. Open-pollinated or heirloom varieties like <a href=\"/products/marketmore-cucumber/\">Marketmore</a> or <a href=\"/products/national-pickling-cucumber/\">National Pickling</a> cucumbers are monoecious in the vegetable garden. The male flowers will start to produce quickly and the female flowers will develop shortly after so pollen will be available when pollination is ready. While gynoecious cucumbers produce predominantly female flowers. Therefore they produce a lot of fruit in a shorter amount of time than monoecious cucumbers. The gynoecious cucumbers like the <a href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\">Stonewall</a> or <a href=\"/products/calypso-cucumber/\">Calypso</a> cucumbers are hybrid varieties that contain a strong disease resistance in the vegetable garden. To disguise the two different varieties the gynoecious has a tiny cucumber at the base of the flower and that's where the female reproductive system is going to get pollinated. While the monoecious has no tiny cucumber at the base of the plant and has a flower where the pollen will fall to pollinate the female flower. Overall, monoecious and gynoecious cucumbers have a couple of differences, but both have great varieties of cucumbers to grow in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Most Productive Cucumbers</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the difference between monoecious and gynoecious cucumbers in the vegetable garden. In Travis's garden, he has Stonewall cucumbers which are a slicer variety and are gynoecious which causes an increase in productivity. So you may be wondering how do the gynoecious cucumbers ever pollinate if there are not any male flowers. The answer is rather simple with every pack of gynoecious seeds, about one and every ten seeds is an open-pollinated variety that will provide the male flowers that the female flowers need for pollination. Along with early production, you can get maximum productive cucumbers by growing the gynoecious varieties in the vegetable garden. The advantage of growing gynoecious varieties is the amount of maximum production you are able to harvest in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Growing Cucumbers in the Garden</h2>\nWhen planting cucumbers in the vegetable garden they do best when direct-seeded. There are two ways you can direct seed these cucumber varieties either by hand or with our walk-behind <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. Our garden seeder comes with six adjustable plates that vary in seed size variations to fit a variety of vegetable seeds in the garden. The benefit of using our garden seeder is accurate planting without wasting seed by overplanting in the garden. We recommend planting cucumber seeds every 6 to 8 inches and thining to one seed per foot to provide plenty of growth in the vegetable garden. Since cucumbers are vining plants they grow best when a trellis system is available for them to climb on. When using a strong trellised system not only will it allow for greater production but it will also reduce disease pressures. Having cucumbers growing vertically instead of on the ground will reduce mildew diseases and other soil-borne diseases that trap excessive moisture in the vegetable garden. Another benefit of growing cucumbers on a trellis is the ability to improve production, easier harvest, and cleaner fruits. The best time to harvest is when cucumbers have reached an average size of 8 to 9 inches. If left on the vine to grow longer the cucumbers will develop a bitter taste and ruin the fresh flavor profile. Cucumbers usually take around 60 days to mature in the vegetable garden and should be picked at least every other day. In order to have productive cucumbers growing in the vegetable garden try growing the gynoecious varieties in the future growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd_mm2-XwVw&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=63&amp;t=3s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Summer Squash Varieties</h2>\nIn the garden, Travis has a second succession planting of the patty-pan variety of summer squash. The <a href=\"/products/sunburst-squash/\">Sunburst</a> squash is a productive hybrid variety that contains a bright yellow color with scalloped edges. The other patty-pan squash is an heirloom variety known as <a href=\"/products/bennings-green-tint-squash/\">Bennings Green Tint</a>. Instead of a yellow, this variety is a lighter green color with scalloped edges. Other than patty-pan squash we also have an Eight Ball and Goldprize Squash variety. The <a href=\"/products/eight-ball-squash/\">Eight Ball</a> is a hybrid variety that produces round fruits with a great flavor profile and texture. The <a href=\"/products/goldprize-squash/\">Goldprize</a> is a highly productive variety that produces straightneck yellow squash that has excellent disease resistance. Along with squash, we offer a Golden Delight and Spineless Beauty Zucchini variety. The <a href=\"/products/golden-delight-zucchini/\">Gold Delight Zucchini</a> variety also contains a disease resistance that allows for an increase in productivity and longer harvesting windows. While the <a href=\"/products/spineless-beauty-zucchini/\">Spineless Beauty Zucchini</a> is easy to harvest due to the spineless petioles which means no itching sensation when harvesting in the vegetable garden. Like squash, zucchini varieties have multiple harvestings throughout the growing season in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Planting Summer Squash</h2>\nWhen planting summer squash they typically take 50 days to mature in the vegetable garden. The best way to plant summer squash is by transplant or direct-seeded. However, we highly recommend direct-seeding because of seed size variations. In order to direct seed in the vegetable garden, we prefer planting seeds 12 inches apart along the row. Once the squash plants start to emerge we thin plants to one every two feet to allow for more growing space. Since summer squash is susceptible to downy mildew and powdery mildew we recommend using <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> to help these disease pressures. Adding drip tape will not only help reduce plant moisture but it will help with feeding the plants more effectively in the vegetable garden. Using a fungicide like <a href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\">Liquid Copper</a> will help reduce disease pressures during heavy rainfalls and excessive moisture. When harvesting summer squash you are able to get multiple harvests throughout the growing season. Harvesting every two to three days ensures that the fruits are a perfect size and flavorful. After harvesting, summer squash should be removed to prevent fungal spores from overwintering and causing serious problems in the future growing seasons. Also, great crop rotation of all squash varieties is important to reduce pest and disease pressures in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Cooking Patty Pan Squash</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the best squash recipe to try at home for patty-pan squash, onions, and bell peppers that have been grown in the vegetable garden. Along with cooking the patty-pan squash, Travis likes to add the Texas Legend onion and bell peppers to go with the recipe to add more flavor and texture. The first step in making the easiest and quickest squash recipe is to cut up the vegetables. When cutting the patty-pan squash the best way to cut them is like cutting a pizza, so they end up like little wedges. With longer patty-pan squash, he likes to cut it in half then make the wedges. While he simply cuts the onions and bell peppers in slices. Next, once the griddle becomes hot we can add a little oil and the squash, onions, and peppers to start cooking. Then, add a little salt and pepper for seasoning. Once everything is browned up and tender they are ready to remove from the griddle and eat. This is a simple and quick squash recipe that is perfect for patty-pan squash, onions, and bell peppers that are grown in the garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRy_oSVlXUA&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=62&amp;t=105s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:29-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Trellised Peppers and Eggplants</h2>\nIn the garden, Travis has <a href=\"/products/merlot-purple-bell-pepper/\">Merlot Purple Bell Pepper</a>, Beaver Dam Hot Peppers, and <a href=\"/products/nubia-eggplant/\">Nubia Eggplant</a> growing on a Florida Weave trellis. The Merlot Purple pepper is a highly productive hybrid variety that contains a deep purple exterior with plants growing around 2 to 3 inches tall. Next, the <a href=\"/products/beaver-dam-hot-pepper/\">Beaver Dam Hot Pepper</a> is an heirloom variety that has a mild flavor profile and great for stuffing. While the Nubia Eggplant is another productive hybrid variety that has a purple and white streak appearance. When planting peppers and eggplants they do best when transplanted in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. Transplanting allows for you to get a headstart on the growing season and have plants ready to go in the ground when weather conditions are right. If weather conditions are not right they should be stepped up into 4-inch pots to allow for more growth. The <a href=\"\">Florida Weave trellis</a> is a simple technique that ensures enough support for crops that need to grow upright or vertically in the vegetable garden. For this trellis system, all you will need is t-post, wooden stakes, and <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">gro-tie garden twine</a>. When having trellised peppers and eggplants we are able to reduce soil-borne diseases and maintain healthier crops. Plants like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants are all in the nightshade family and susceptible to blossom end rot. To avoid the blossom end rot problems we suggest using <a href=\"/products/pelletized-gypsum-soil-conditioner/\">pelleted gypsum</a> at the base of the plant.\n<h2>Reducing Weeds in the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks reducing weeds from trellised peppers in the vegetable garden. However, the problem with growing crops on the Florida Weave trellis is it can sometimes be difficult to control the weeds in the garden area. Due to this trellis technique having string along the row to support the plants we aren't able to get under the area with a hoe to clear the weeds out. This year, Travis decided to try a new technique using wheat straw underneath the trellis to help control the weeds and preserve moisture from the drip irrigation. Using the wheat straw instead of woodchips because it will be easier to remove from the area once the peppers are done. Once the peppers are done in the garden, Travis plans to plant either some cool weather crops or cover crops. So it's important to quickly remove the wheat straw out of the garden with either a <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">dura rake</a> or blower. When trying to reduce weeds for trellised peppers, eggplants, or tomatoes in the garden try using some wheat straw that is easier to quickly remove than mulch or woodchips.\n<h2>Importance of Removing Weeds</h2>\nWhen trying to grow the most productive and healthiest vegetables it can become an important task to keep the weed pressures from the garden area. When weeds are in the vegetable garden they steal soil nutrients and water from the plants. If plants do not get all the necessary nutrients they will become weak, not produce, and even die. Another important reason to remove weeds is they can be a hiding spot for pests that are actually eating away at your plants in the vegetable garden. The best way to suppress these weed pressures is by growing cover crops in the garden. Some cover crops like <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a>, <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, <a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\">Daikon Radish</a>, and <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> all have traits that grow fast in order to outpace weed growth. When planting cover crops we prefer to use our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> to get a precise planting in the vegetable garden. However, with all cover crops, they should be incorporated back into the soil before going to seed to prevent reseeding problems.\n\n&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=61&amp;t=11s\n            <div class=\"video-container\">\n              <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZlSxP-o74Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n            </div>\n          ",

    "body_html": "<h2>Spaghetti Squash in the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the best time to harvest winter squash in the garden. It's been around 90 days since he planted some <a href=\"/products/small-wonder-spaghetti-squash/\">Small Wonder Spaghetti Squash</a>. This type of variety is known as a personal-sized spaghetti squash because they are about half the size of a normal-sized squash. With higher yields than larger spaghetti squash varieties, you can grow fruit in the same amount of space in the garden area. When planting this variety of winter squash we highly recommend direct seeding, but you can transplant as well. We prefer to plant this winter squash variety around 12 inches apart along the row in the vegetable garden. When plants start to emerge in the garden you should thin plants to one every 2 feet. They have a vining growth habit and will reach 4 to 6 inches in length in the vegetable garden. Winter squash can sometimes be susceptible to downy mildew and powdery mildew when the garden contains excess moisture. In order to prevent these issues, we recommend using <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> to reduce plant moisture and adequately feed the plants. Using drip irrigation allows you to supply water right to the plant roots where they need it the most all while conserving water and reducing weed pressures. Another way to eliminate disease pressures when there are periods of heavy rainfall is by using a fungicide like <a href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\">Liquid Copper</a>. This type of fungicide will help prevent diseases from attacking fruits, nuts, vegetables, and citrus. It is also important to have great crop rotation when planting winter squash to reduce disease and pest pressures.\n<h2>Harvest Winter Squash</h2>\nWhen harvesting spaghetti squash they will only produce a one-time harvest at the end of the growing season. There are a few indicators when it comes to determining the best time to harvest winter squash in the vegetable garden. One way to know when the winter squash is ready to harvest is when the plants and leaves start to become crispy and die back in the garden. Another way you can tell they are ready for harvest is the color will start to fully develop. The spaghetti squash is initially a green color, but they become a bright yellow color when ready for harvest. Next way to figure out if they are ready is by scratching at the skin layer. When scratching the skin with your fingernail if the skin doesn't come off and seems to be hard it is ready for harvest. Finally, the last way to tell is if the stem at the top of the squash is dry and hard then it is the perfect time to harvest winter squash. A great tool to use when harvesting spaghetti squash is a pair of <a href=\"/products/pruning-shears/\">pruning shears</a>. Once you finish harvesting all the squash they should be stored on a storage rack in the barn with plenty of airflow and shade. This variety of winter squash will typically store for up to 5 or 6 months underneath the barn.\n<h2>Other Winter Squash Varieties</h2>\nAlong with the spaghetti squash variety, we offer Hai Kabocha, Butternut, and Delicata squash varieties. The <a href=\"/products/hai-kabocha-squash/\">Hai Kabocha</a> is one of the tastiest winter squashes to grow in the vegetable garden. This variety produces dark green fruits with gray speckling and a bright yellow flesh interior. The <a href=\"/products/hoss-butternut-squash/\">Hoss Butternut</a> squash is a hybrid variety that produces large uniformity fruits. This is another variety that has excellent flavor and texture. Another variety is the <a href=\"/products/delicata-winter-squash/\">Delicata Winter Squash</a> that contains a higher sugar content and sweeter flavor than other squash varieties. This variety produces fruits with a creamy-white color with green specks and stripes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3D8lQ0WlNA&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=60&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:28-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Productive Crops to Grow in the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis goes over the go-to crops that are the most productive in the vegetable garden. His go-to most productive crops that can be grown for 10 months out of the year is Lacinato Kale and Tiger Collards. The <a href=\"/products/lacinato-kale/\">Lacinato kale</a> is an heirloom variety that produces long and slender leaves year-round. Typically we plant this kale variety in the early fall and it will grow throughout the entire winter and spring. However, if we plant it in the spring it will grow well in the warmer months as well. Although you can direct seed the Lacinato kale we recommend transplanting this variety. Transplanting allows for more consistent plant spacing and reduces weed pressures from taking over when the seedlings are in the early stages in the vegetable garden. To harvest, you simply pull the bottom leaves off and leave a few at the top so the plant can continue to grow during the growing season. This variety continues to produce well and should be harvested at least every other week. Much like the Lacinato Kale, the Tiger Collards can be grown throughout 10 months out of the year. The <a href=\"/products/tiger-collard/\">Tiger Collards</a> can be planted during the fall and spring growing seasons. They are extremely bolt resistant so they grow well in the warmer and colder weather conditions. The Tiger collard variety can be either direct-seeded or transplanted. You can use our walk-behind <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> to direct seed dense plants rows in the garden. If you prefer to transplant you can use our seed starting trays leaving plants ready to go in the ground with weather conditions are just right. Much like kale, when harvesting the Tiger collards we pluck the bottom leaves and leave a few at the top to get continuous growth. These two different varieties of plants are the most productive crops to grow in the vegetable garden due to getting high yields and can be grown 10 months out of the year, unlike other crops.\n<h2>Why is Crop Rotation Important?</h2>\nGrowing different types of vegetables in the same garden spot over several growing seasons will help improve the productivity of crops. Planting the same crop in the same spot year after year can cause several problems in the garden. The first problem it can cause is the decrease of soil nutrients. When planting in the same spot you are draining the soil from the same nutrients needed for plant growth. Another problem is the increase in pest pressures. Having the same crop in the same spot can leave the area as a comfortable habitat for pest because they get used to the crop being in that area. By incorporating a better crop rotation you can eliminate those problems in the vegetable garden. With better crop rotation, this allows for a variety of different plants to be grown in the garden allowing for different nutrients for plants to be taken up in the soil. Another benefit of leaving the garden fallow between seasons allows for the replenish of nutrients in the vegetable garden. We like to incorporate cover crops during the warmer months when it's harder to grow vegetables. Some cover crops such as <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>, <a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\">Diakon Radish</a>, and <a href=\"/products/winter-rye/\">Winter Rye</a> will help build the soil nutrients. While the <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a>, and <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a> all help with suppressing weed pressures in the vegetable garden. So instead of having one large garden spot, it is best to break up the garden area into subplots to enforce an easier and manageable crop rotation in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw-td2Zqy14&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=59&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:28-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Okra Plants</h2>\nWhen planting okra the best time to plant is during the spring, summer, or fall months. Due to these plants loving the warmer weather temperatures they need to be planted in an area with plenty of sunlight. We recommend transplanting okra in the early spring to get a jumpstart on production and early germination of plants during the growing season. When transplanting using our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> this will ensure you develop a solid root ball because of the internal root training ribs that help the plants grow properly and reduce transplant shock when placed in the garden area. If you would rather direct seed okra plants the best time is either late spring or summer using our walk-behind <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. It comes with six adjustable seed plates that allow for a variety of different seeds to be planted in the seeder. The two most productive okra varieties we offer is <a href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\">Jambalaya</a> and <a href=\"/products/red-burgundy-okra/\">Red Burgundy</a>. The Jambalaya okra is a hybrid variety that produces green pods that have heavy yields that are great for pickling, frying, or stewing. While the Red Burgundy is a highly-productive heirloom variety that has dark red pods that stay tender at longer pod lengths. Another benefit of growing okra is they work great for succession planting throughout the warmer months. When picked regularly you are able to get multiple harvests off one okra plant. The best time to harvest okra pods is when they reach around 3 to 5 inches in length. However, once okra plants get so tall they become less productive and harvesting will be more difficult. A major pest that can harm the growth of okra plants is root-knot nematodes. Which cause knots on the roots of the plants that can drain the nutrients from the plants leaving them wilted. There are a couple of different ways to control these nematode problems in the garden area. Travis recommends using a cover crop like <a href=\"/products/broadleaf-mustard/\">Broadleaf Mustard</a> that will release chemicals to help suppress nematode, fungi, and insect populations and increase organic matter which will improve soil tilth and quality of the soil structure in the vegetable garden area.\n<h2>Pruning Okra in the Vegetable Garden</h2>\nIn this week's episode, Travis talks about how to prune okra for an easier harvest. In the garden, Travis currently has okra plants that are around knee-high that started producing pods when they were only about a foot tall. When going to prune okra instead of cutting it off right below the pod, Travis prefers to cut the pod and the lateral branch too. He prefers to do this because it will keep the bottom of the plant nice, clean, and easier to see the okra when it comes time for harvesting. So when using the <a href=\"/products/pruning-shears/\">pruning shears</a>, he will cut where the okra pod and the lateral branch stem meet which gives us a clean-cut and a nice little okra pod picked. The difference between pruning and \"whooping\" okra plants is when whooping you are beating the side of the okra plants. The theory behind beating the okra plants is you are stressing the plants in order to get more production in the vegetable garden. Travis has tried the pruning or whooping method before in the garden and says it does make the garden easier to harvest and get better production of okra pods. Overall, when pruning okra cut them at the meeting of the okra pod and lateral branch stem to ensure you get an easy harvest and manageable okra plants in the garden area all throughout the growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax8TABaOz6U&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=57",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:27-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Harvesting Containers</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks all about our TubTrug harvesting containers. The TubTrugs are made to be lightweight and flexible for many different uses in the garden and around the homestead. Unlike other plastic harvesting buckets, the TubTrugs are UV resistance so they will not crack if left out in the sun and become damaged from other harsh weather conditions. These TubTrugs come in various sizes such as the <a href=\"/products/mini-shallow-tubtrug/\">Mini Shallow</a>, <a href=\"/products/small-tubtrug/\">Small</a>, <a href=\"/products/small-shallow-tubtrug/\">Small Shallow</a>, <a href=\"/products/medium-tubtrug/\">Medium</a>, and <a href=\"/products/large-shallow-tubtrug/\">Large Shallow</a>. The mini shallow has a 1.3g capacity that works best for small harvests or used on the homestead for food prep. The small TubTrug is 3.7g capacity and works great for dinner harvest or for storing and transport small garden tools to and from the garden area. While the small shallow TubTrug has a 4g capacity and works perfectly for sorting, cleaning, and processing vegetables. Next, the medium container has a 6.9g capacity that works for many different vegetables like squash, cucumbers, corn, and potatoes. Then finally the large shallow has a 9.2g capacity for sorting, cleaning, and processing larger harvestings from the garden. You can also get a variation of the sizes in our <a href=\"/products/tubtrug-bundle-4-pack/\">TubTrugs bundle</a>. Also, available in a heavy-duty mesh <a href=\"/products/tubtrug-colander/\">colander</a> design that allows for water and dirt to freely flow through it. Travis demonstrates a trick for easily washing your vegetables with the medium and colander TubTrug. Before you bring them inside to start cooking them you must first wash them off. To begin, take the medium TubTrug and fill it halfway with water. Then, place the vegetables in the TubTrug colander. The colander fits perfectly in the medium container so we take the colander and dip it the water and swish it around in the medium container. Once the vegetables are nice and clean you can simply pull the colander up from the medium container and take the colander inside. The colanders mesh design ensures that all the water will drain out properly so you don't have to worry about it dripping throughout the house. Using this trick will provide you a quick and easy way to simply wash and clean your vegetables before bringing them inside to cook.\n<h2>Other Harvesting Supplies</h2>\nAlong with the TubTrug containers, we also offer an <a href=\"/products/shoulder-harvesting-fruit-bucket/\">Over the Shoulder Harvesting Bucket</a> and <a href=\"/products/garden-hod/\">Garden Hod</a>. The Over the Shoulder Harvesting Bucket contains adjustable straps and padded area on the back for extra comfort. The garden hod is a multifunctional harvesting bucket that allows you to harvest vegetables and quickly rinse them off all in one container. The heavy-duty mesh wire with weather-resistant wood will last for multiple harvestings in the vegetable garden. Another handy tool to have when harvesting vegetables in the garden area is our <a href=\"/products/handy-twine-knife/\">Handy Twine Knife</a>. The twine knife contains a blade on a ring that is supposed to be worn on your finger. It can fit either below or above the knuckle of your finger and is only sharp on the inside making it safe to use and carry. This allows you to quickly harvest trellising tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, cut flowers, and other vegetables. Other harvesting supplies include a couple of knives such as the <a href=\"/products/cabbage-knife/\">Cabbage knife</a>, <a href=\"/products/california-knife/\">California knife</a>, and <a href=\"/products/asparagus-knife/\">Asparagus knife</a>. As well as a <a href=\"/products/garden-knife-combo/\">Garden Knife Combo</a> that contains the Cabbage and California knife and a <a href=\"/products/farmers-file/\">Farmers file</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElqlsRwJFU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=57&amp;t=35s",

    "title": "Increasing Production by Pruning Zinnias",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:27-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Zinnias in the Garden</h2>\nThere are several different color variations of the Benary Giant Zinnia varieties that we offer such as <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-lime-zinnia/\">Lime</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-coral-zinnia/\">Coral</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-orange-zinnia/\">Orange</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-scarlet-zinnia/\">Scarlet</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-wine-zinnia/\">Wine</a>, and <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-white-zinnia/\">White</a>. We also offer a <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-zinnia-mix/\">Benary Giant Zinnia Mix</a> that contains deep red, orange, coral, lime, wine, bright pink, white, purple, salmon rose, golden yellow, scarlet, and carmine rose. Not only do these zinnias produce a variety of beautiful colors, but they also attract pollinators which allows for many benefits in the vegetable garden. When planting zinnias they can either be planted by transplant or direct-seeded. When transplanting they work great in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> that have internal vertical root training ribs that help with aeration and root ball drainage. A benefit of transplanting is the ability to get a jumpstart on the growing season and have plants ready to go in the ground by the time the weather conditions are just right. When direct seeding you can not use our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> due to the oblong seed size. Therefore, when direct seeding by hand you should make a small furrow in the soil and scatter the zinnia seeds along the furrow. Then lightly cover the seeds with a <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">garden rake</a> and pack the planted area in the vegetable garden. We recommend planting zinnias on double rows with <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a> to conserve water and maximize garden space. When burying drip tape in the garden it ensures that you are providing water directly to the plant roots that need it. By planting zinnias on either side of the drip tape you can get more production off one row in the vegetable garden. Typically zinnias are planted during the spring and take around 75 days to mature. They're also very heat-tolerant so they will continue to produce throughout the warmer months of summer.\n<h2>Increasing Production of Zinnias</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains how to get more production by pruning zinnias in the garden. When planting zinnias on a double row in the vegetable garden it helps to decrease weed pressure and fill out the area with nice bushy plants. Also, when planting zinnias if they are transplanted and we let them grow straight up they are more susceptible to being blown over by the wind. To avoid them being blown over we want the zinnias to grow more laterally and bush out along the garden rows. When pruning zinnias, you want to go all the way down to the nearest branch that is splitting off and prune it off there. By pruning your zinnias in the vegetable garden you will increase your production and improve thicker growth to maintain a beautiful harvest of flowers throughout the entire growing season.\n<h2>Why Grow Flowers in the Vegetable Garden?</h2>\nWe recommend growing flowers in the vegetable garden to increase pollination and harvests. Honeybees, butterflies, birds, and other pollinators are all attracted to flowers. We need pollinators in our garden to increase the production of seeds and for plant reproduction. As more pollinators come into the garden there is more pollen being transferred from the male anther to the female stigma. As insects collect the pollen they will in return distribute it to vegetables which will increase your overall harvestings in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhWRvGDYb6c&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=56&amp;t=3s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:26-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Good Soil Structures</h2>\nThere are a couple of important benefits to having good soil structure in the vegetable garden. The first benefit is the improvement of crop quality. The crop quality in the soil is important because the plant roots need the ability to move throughout the soil structure to find the essential nutrients that they are dependent on. The next benefit is to reduce pest and disease pressures in the soil. Much like humans, when plants lack nutrition they can be more susceptible to diseases. However, with a healthy soil structure pest and diseases lack in the ability to live in the garden area. Another important benefit of good soil structure is the ability to conserve water. The increase in water holding capacity can prevent soil nutrients from leaching in the garden area. The decrease in leaching of soil nutrients will improve a stronger soil structure that will not be broken down by water and wind leading to soil erosion problems. Overall a good soil structure will in return improve the soil health which will lead to productive vegetable plants in the garden area. Some other ways to increase good soil structure is by incorporating good compost or organic matter and side-dressing fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Improving Soil Nutrients</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains how to improve soil nutrients to get healthier plants. The first step in improving soil nutrients is to understand the importance of maintaining healthy soil biology in our soil structures. Promoting healthy soil biology will increase the beneficial bacteria and microorganisms that live in the soil will in return provide us healthier plants. A great product that will help feed the soil and promote that healthy soil biology is our <a href=\"/products/liqui-fish-garden-fertilizer/\">Hoss Liqui-Fish Garden Fertilizer</a>. This Liqui-Fish is an OMRI registered fish emulsion that will improve the macro and micronutrients in the vegetable garden area. Unlike other fish emulsions, our Liqui-Fish is hydrolyzed which means the fish are broken down using water instead of heat. We use water instead of heat because if you break down the fish using heat you eliminate a lot of the proteins, nutrients, and vitamins that are needed to feed your soil in the garden. So by using the hydrolized fish emulsion, we are preserving all the nutrients that are needed for healthy soil biology in the vegetable garden area. This emulsion can be used in a couple of different forms of application such as by soil drench. When soil drenching it can be applied before you plant or several times throughout the life of the plant to continue improving soil life and give plants plenty of nutrients. The Liqui-Fish works greats in our <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo Fertilizer injector</a> if you use a <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> system in the garden. However, it can also be used in a <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-sprayer/\">hand-pump garden sprayer</a> and apply it to the soil that way. Travis mentions that the recommended rate of the Liqui-Fish is a cup per thousand square feet. When looking to promote healthier soil biology and grow healthier plants look into applying a hydrolized fish emulsion like the Liqui-Fish to ensure you get the best results in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LAbsAkr2IU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=55&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:26-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Essential Nutrients for Vegetable Plants</h2>\nWhen breaking down all the various essential nutrients that vegetable plants need in the garden can be hard to understand at first. However, the three major nutrients that plants need are nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous. Nitrogen is important for the improvement of great stalk growth and productivity of plant fruits. While potassium provides nutrients for root and seed production. Then, phosphorous strengths the overall root development which helps to prevent disease and pest pressures. Along with the major nutrients, plants need essential micronutrients in the vegetable garden as well. The micronutrients include sulfur which helps the plants use the available nitrogen in the soil. While boron helps with the overall sugar transport in the plants and iron is involved in pigment formation and energy production. Also, copper provides plant respiration, flavor profile, and color in vegetable plants. Finally, magnesium allows chlorophyll to capture the suns energy that is needed for photosynthesis in the garden. Another advantage of having essential nutrients is to help improve soil structure in the vegetable garden. Using good compost and cover crops will help supply the soil with all the essential nutrients that plants needed. Depending on certain <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/cover-crop-seeds/\">cover crops</a> they can help improve soil levels, decrease soil-borne disease, suppress weed growth, and improve the organic matter in the vegetable garden. Another way to supply nutrients to the vegetables and soil is by adding fertilizer to the desired garden area. Overall, supplying the garden with the important essential nutrients will maintain healthy and productive yields in the vegetable plants.\n<h2>Vegetable Garden Plant Needs</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains what your vegetable plants need in the garden. We all know the major nutrients that plants require is nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. However, the vegetable plants that we grow also need essential micronutrients which are elements that are needed by the plant in smaller quantities. Some of these micronutrients include boron, sulfur, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, and manganese. These essential micronutrients are important for amino acids, chlorophyll, and enzyme production. All of these elements help the plant photosynthesize and maintain healthy plants in our vegetable garden. Our newest product called <a href=\"/products/micro-boost/\">Micro-Boost</a> is exactly what you need for your vegetable garden plants. The micro-boost is a liquid formulation that includes many essential micronutrients. This micro-boost is used as a fertilizer additive so you add it just like other fertilizer products. Travis mentions that the recommended rate of the micro-boost is 1/4 cup per 1,000 square feet of the vegetable garden. So to incorporate the micro-boost into your garden area you should add some of it to your other garden fertilizer either weekly or bi-weekly depending on how often you fertilize your garden. There are two different ways you can apply the micro-boost in the vegetable garden. The first technique is adding it to our <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo fertilizer injector</a>. When adding either the <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> or <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a> to the fertilizer injector you simply add a couple of cups of Micro-Boost depending on the area you are wanting to cover in the vegetable garden. If you don't have an EZ-Flo injector you can also add the Micro-Boost using a hand-pump <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-sprayer/\">garden sprayer</a>. With the garden sprayer, you add a quarter cup or half cup depending on the area you want to cover in the vegetable garden. Then, you simply unscrew the sprayer tip off the end of the sprayer wand and drizzle it alongside the plants in the garden row. Whether you are using a fertilizer injector or garden sprayer both techniques work great to add the Micro-Boost to ensure your vegetable crops get all the essential nutrients that they need for plant growth.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xh4QPmYA50&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=54&amp;t=7s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Trellising Tomato Plants</h2>\nWhen it comes to trellising tomato plants there are many advantages that improve the overall health of these plants. The easiest Florida weave trellis technique is used for determinate tomatoes, while tomato cages are typically used for indeterminate tomatoes in the vegetable garden. We use the tomato cages for indeterminate tomatoes because they have continuous growth and will grow a lot taller than determinate tomatoes. We use the Flordia weave trellis technique for determinate tomatoes because they tend to grow smaller and have earlier harvesting times in the vegetable garden. The advantages of trellising tomato plants include more exposure to sunlight, improve the quality of foliage, and reduce disease pressures. With better exposure to sunlight, the tomato plants will continue to grow and increase productivity. Another benefit of adding the trellis technique is it makes pruning, fertilizing, and harvesting easier when it comes time. Also, the plants are growing vertically so there is a decrease in soil-borne disease pressures due to the plants not growing on the ground in the vegetable garden. Overall, trellising tomato plants ensures they are getting all the support they need to continue to grow in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Florida Weave Technique</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the easy Florida Weave trellis technique for tomatoes. When setting up the Florida weave trellis, you will need t-posts, wooden stakes, and <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">gro-tie garden twine</a>. To set up this trellis technique start by placing a T-posts on either each end of the row and add wooden stakes between each plant. When adding the wooden stakes be careful not to puncture the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a> that is already buried in the ground. To begin adding the first line of string or twine, you simply tie it off on the end of the T-post. Then weave it along the first plant on one side and around the wooden stake then on the next plant place the twine on the other side of the plant. You should alternate from plant to plant along the row until you reach the other end T-post. When you reach the end T-Post, you will go back along the row, but placing the twine on the other side of each plant. So when you are done you should have twine on each side of the plant stem along the garden row. There are two different ways you can accomplish the easiest Florida weave trellis technique. The first method is using our <a href=\"/products/cotton-butcher-twine/\">cotton twine roll</a> that comes in handy for shorter garden rows. The cotton twine is completely biodegradable and environmentally friendly. When using the cotton twine to add the Florida weave you will be leaning over using your hands to wrap the twine around the stakes and weaving around the plants. The second method is using our <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">Gro-Tie garden twine</a> that contains over a mile of twine which is great for longer garden rows. When using the poly garden twine it comes with an attached belt opening to place on your belt loop that allows for no strain on your back. Then with a piece of PVC pipe depending on your height, you can feed the twine through the pipe to guide around the stakes and plants. When working on the easiest Florida Weave trellis you should make to keep the twine nice and tight to ensure the plants get plenty of support in the vegetable garden. However, whether you use the cotton twine or poly garden twine is based on your personal preference, but incorporating a great trellising technique will ensure an improvement in your tomato plants in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxW40Qw0VLI&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=52&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:24-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Indeterminate vs. Determinate Tomatoes</h2>\nDepending on certain tomato varieties they can vary from indeterminate and determinate. When distinguishing between the two different tomatoes, indeterminate tomatoes have a longer growing period than determinate tomatoes that tend to ripen quickly. Determinate tomato varieties will stop growing once fruits set on the ends of the top bud. While indeterminate tomatoes will continue to form flowers up until weather conditions are not right. The overall difference between the different varieties is determinate tomatoes are typically smaller and they produce early on in the vegetable garden. The indeterminate tomatoes will have continuous growth and produce fruits throughout the entire growing season. If you want to harvest an early-season crop of tomatoes or have a continuous harvesting supply throughout the season, choosing between indeterminate and determinate tomatoes is all based on your preference in the garden area.\n<h2>Best Cages for Trellising Tomatoes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains cages for trellising indeterminate tomatoes in the garden. Due to all these varieties being either indeterminate or determinate tomatoes they are certain trellising techniques that work better for each crop. Overall, indeterminate tomatoes will grow a lot taller than determinate tomatoes in the vegetable garden. Instead of using the Florida Weave trellis technique we will use tomato cages because they work better for taller tomato plants that continue to grow much longer than determinate tomatoes. The best cages for trellising indeterminate varieties are our <a href=\"/products/tomato-cages/\">tomato cages</a> that are made with a heavy-duty, 8 gauge galvanized steel so you don't have to worry about them rusting. They are 56 inches tall, but after placing them in the ground they are around 45 inches off the ground. The overall opening at the top is 14 x 14 inches to give you plenty of space for the tomatoes to grow. The tomato cages also have wide openings to allow plenty of space to harvest the tomatoes and prune the plants when needed. Travis's favorite thing about these tomato cages is the fact that they are collapsible to ensure you get many uses year after year. When the tomato plants are done, you can simply fold the cages up and store them away in your barn till the next time you need them in the garden. These tomato cages offer plenty of support for indeterminate tomatoes all throughout the growing season and will last for several future growing seasons.\n<h2>Tomato Varieties</h2>\nTravis currently has a couple of tomato varieties growing in the garden such as Amish Paste, Cherokee Purple, Sun Gold, and Jubilee. The <a href=\"/products/amish-paste-tomato/\">Amish Paste</a> is an heirloom or open-pollinated variety that produces Roma-type tomatoes that are usually oblong and vary in shape. While the <a href=\"/products/cherokee-purple-tomato/\">Cherokee Purple</a> is another older heirloom variety that has deep red fruits that are normally very large and sweet in flavor. The next variety is a hybrid that is known for its exceptional flavor profile, <a href=\"/products/sun-gold-tomato/\">Sun Gold</a>. This Sun Gold variety grows in clusters producing yellowish, gold, and cherry tomatoes. The last indeterminate tomato is the <a href=\"/products/jubilee-tomato/\">Jubilee</a> variety which produces golden-yellow tomatoes with a great flavor profile. Some determinate varieties that we offer are <a href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\">Bella Rosa</a>, <a href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\">Brickyard</a>, and <a href=\"/products/mountain-glory-tomato/\">Mountain Glory</a>. We recommend growing tomatoes in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> to get maximum production. Another benefit of planting in the seed trays is the ability to get a jumpstart on the growing season and having plants ready to go in the ground as soon as the weather conditions are favorable.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxaQxcl4TsQ&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=51&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:23-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Most Effective Trellis for Tomato Plants</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the most effective trellis technique that he has come across so far in the vegetable garden. He currently has three rows of determinate tomatoes such as Bella Rosa, Brickyard, and Mountain Glory growing in the garden. When trellising tomatoes we recommend using the Florida Weave technique to keep the plants off the ground and healthy. The tomato plants are currently only about a foot tall so not ready for the first string, but Travis likes to go ahead and add stakes in the ground. As well as, prune the bottom lateral stems and hill the plants for stabilization and better root development. In doing this it makes it easier to add the stakes without puncturing the already laid <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a>. When adding the wooden stakes to the ground, Travis recommends digging in the ground where you want the stake to find the drip tape and then place the pointed end of the stake right next to the drip tape in the middle of each plant in the garden row. Travis prefers to use T-posts and squared wooden stakes because they tend to work better than stakes that are round. The round stakes do not allow for enough friction like the wooden stakes. So by placing the T-posts on each end of the row and one in the middle, this ensures plenty of stability for the tomato plants. Once the plants get a little taller and the stems get thicker you will be ready to run your first line of the Florida Weave trellis. Then, continue to add twine as the tomato plants grow throughout the growing season in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Florida Weave Technique</h2>\nWhy is the Florida Weave method the most effective trellis technique in the garden? Not only is this an effective method, but it is extremely simple and manageable too. With a set of wooden stakes and t-posts, you can set up the most effective trellis technique. For the twine, we have two options available such as the <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">gro-tie garden twine</a> and <a href=\"/products/cotton-butcher-twine/\">cotton butcher twine</a>. The gro-tie twine comes in a belt-loop carton that can be attached to your belt for easy access while trellising your tomato plants. The cotton butcher twine comes in a smaller roll and is 100% biodegradable so you don't have to worry if you leave some in the garden area. The reason behind trellising crops like tomatoes, peppers, or cucumbers is to allow them to grow off the ground and they are less susceptible to fungal disease problems. When Travis adds the Florida Weave trellis technique to his garden he likes to have the box of twine on his belt loop and use about a three-foot-long piece of pipe to guide the twine down the row. You should begin by tieing the twine off on the end row stake and taking the twine that runs through the pipe to guide the twine throughout the garden row. By weaving the string through one plant and around the stake a couple of times then weaving through the next plant along the entire row. Then once you reach the end of the row you should go back through to the opposite side of each plant to provide support on both sides of the plant. Once you have completed running twine through both sides of the plant you have successfully done the <a href=\"\">Florida Weave technique</a>. Then as the plants continue to grow to add a 2nd and 3rd line of twine will help them continue to grow with plenty of stability and provide maximum tomato yields.\n\n&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s\n            <div class=\"video-container\">\n              <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GnacfDinjzc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n            </div>\n          ",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:23-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Quick and Easy Crop Turnover</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis demonstrates how to quickly and easily turnover crops in the vegetable garden. In order for us to efficiently grow crops year-round in the vegetable garden, we have to maintain a quick and easy crop turnover time. In the garden, Travis has a couple of rows of romaine lettuce that he has just finished harvesting. So after harvesting all the heads of lettuce he then removes the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-start/\">row start</a> fitting from the mainline of <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> irrigation to replace it with a <a href=\"/products/goof-plugs/\">goof plug.</a> The row start is used Then, he will pull the drip tape out of the garden row to clean the garden area. The next step is to cultivate by removing weeds and extra lettuce stalks from the garden area. This task is done with our new <a href=\"/products/hoss-stirrup-hoe/\">Hoss Stirrup Hoe</a> to uproot and turnover the area. The stirrup hoe is the best tool for cultivating and weeding in every direction of the garden whether it is between the plants or alongside the row. After we are done with the hoe we take our <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">Dura Rake</a> and rake out any of the old debris and weeds to get the area clean and level. Travis prefers to take his Wheel Hoe in the area a couple of times over the next couple of weeks to ensure there are no weeds before re-planting. When re-planting all you have to do is create a furrow and re-lay the drip tape that you pulled up earlier and cover it back up in the garden. Replace the goof plug with the row start and then you are ready to plant in that garden area. Overall, to be prepared for a quick and easy crop turnover have a plan set in place to effectively re-plant in that vegetable garden spot.\n<h2>Benefits of Crop Rotation in the Garden</h2>\nCrop rotation has several benefits that will great an overall better vegetable garden area. The first benefit is an increase in better soil structure. When rotating crops around the garden you are preventing a loss of soil nutrients, pest/disease pressures, and soil erosion. By improving our soil structure in the garden we are maintaining the soil with plenty of air, water, and nutrients which is in return needed for plant growth. If we have a poor soil structure we will not develop a healthy root system for plant growth in the vegetable garden. By rotating the crops in the garden we can plan out vegetables that will help improve the soil structure when needed. Another benefit is the prevention of soil erosion. Soil erosion can cause several issues like loss of topsoil and harsh runoff. The reason behind crop rotation is to simply decrease soil erosion problems that is due to the reduction of soil disturbance, diverse root systems, improved healthy soils, and overall spacing in the garden. The soil disturbance is reduced because there is less tilling of the soil structure which means longer periods of soil disturbance. The diverse root systems are due to the variation of crops that have either taproot or fibrous root systems which helps soil particles hold together. The next benefit of crop rotation is reducing pest and disease pressures from continuing to overwinter in the vegetable garden. When cultivating the same crop in the same spot the pests and diseases become used to the conditions so they form in the same spot year after year and can become very difficult to eliminate. Overall, these benefits will create a healthy environment for all the plant life growing in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iNMRimwDc0&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "Seed Size Variations Before Planting in Your Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:23-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Seed Size Variations</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains how seed size variations when using a garden seeder in the vegetable garden. When using our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> to direct seed plants in the garden it comes with six modified seed plates. When planting with the garden seeder this ensures you have the proper seed plates that will help you effectively direct seed and not overplant in the garden area. The #1 seed plate fits broccoli, cabbage, turnips, mustard, and cauliflower seed sizes. While the #2 seed plate fits onion and small coated seeds. Then, the #3 seed plate fits okra, carrots, lettuce, chard, and beets. Next, the #4 seed plate fits small sweet corn seeds. The #5 seed plate fits small peas and beans. The last #6 seed plate fits medium beans and peas and large sweet corn seeds. Travis is using the #5 seed plate to show the different seed size variations of peas. From largest to smallest, he has <a href=\"/products/zipper-cream-pea/\">Zipper Cream</a>, <a href=\"/products/mississippi-purplehull-pea/\">Mississippi Purplehull</a>, Summertime Pinkeye, and Sa Dandy Cream Pea. However, the #5 seed plate does not fit all of these pea seed varieties so Travis has to take his drill to make the holes on the plate larger to fit perfectly. The Zipper Cream and Mississippi Purplehull fits in the seed #5 seed plate when drilled a little larger. While the <a href=\"/products/summertime-pinkeye-pea/\">Summertime Pinkeye</a> and <a href=\"/products/sa-dandy-cream-pea/\">Sa Dandy Cream</a> have a smaller seed size so they work better in the #3 seed plate. When modifying to make larger holes in the seed plates, Travis recommends using a step drill bit to accurately get the desired seed size. We also have <a href=\"/products/garden-seed-plates/\">blank seed plates</a> that you can modify to get holes just right for the several different seed size variations. When planting peas they should be planted with 3 to 4 inches of growing space for each row because of their semi-vining growing habit. When planting peas on double rows we plant two rows about 6 inches apart, then skip over 3 to 4 inches and plant another double row. Planting on double rows allows us to get maximum production and save space in the vegetable garden. When harvesting peas, they should be picked when pods are full and shelling is easy. If they are not shelling easy they should be left in the garden to grow on the plant a little longer.\n<h2>Direct Seeding vs. Transplanting</h2>\nWhen deciding between direct seeding or transplanting in the vegetable garden it all depends on what type of crops you are wanting to grow. Meaning that some vegetables only do well direct seeded while others do better transplanted. Vegetables like tomatoes, kohlrabi, collards, peppers, and cauliflower all do better off in the garden when transplanted. While vegetables like cucumbers, peas, okra, carrots, melons, and turnips do best when direct-seeded. When transplanting in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> this ensures that the plants will get accurate aeration for root ball drainage due to our vertically internal root training ribs. This in return will allow for stronger transplants that will be less likely to have transplant shock and produce a lot quicker. Another advantage of transplanting is the reduce the risk of pest and disease pressures damaging the plants in early growth stages. This also makes them stronger to resistant those pressures when they are transplanted into the vegetable garden. When direct seeding we recommend using our garden seeder that allows you to effectively and quickly plant seeds in the vegetable garden area. However, when direct seeding you may have to thin out seedlings to ensure there is enough room for growth in the vegetable garden area.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvnvDkUk88A&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=4&amp;t=10s",

    "title": "Planting Straight Rows in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:22-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Planting in Rows</h2>\nThe best method when growing vegetables in the garden is by planting in rows. Row planting is when plants are grown in single rows that allow for more space and easier cultivating in the vegetable garden. Depending on how much room plants need for growing the rows can be adjusted between the plants and in each walkway alongside the row. It is more effective for transplanting, direct seeding, drip irrigation, and for the use of garden tools. With drip tape, we prefer this irrigation method over hand-watering because it conserves water, saves time, and allows for the plants to get all the nutrients they need directly to their roots. We also save space by planting along the row side-by-side because more plants can be planted in the garden area. Along with planting in rows, we break our garden up into subplots to make the garden area more manageable and for better crop rotation. Crop rotation is used to eliminate planting crops in the same area year after year which can drain your soil nutrients. Another reason we do this technique is to decrease pest and soil-borne diseases from damaging our plants in the garden. If you plant certain crops in the same area year after year the soil-borne diseases will start to damage that crop the longer they stay in the area. Crop rotation is important to improve the overall success of the vegetable production and soil structures in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Planting Straight Rows</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the importance of planting straight rows in the vegetable garden area. We plant in straight rows because it is more effective and manageable in the garden. When planting side-by-side and parallel to one another we have more space to grow more plants. Another reason for having straight rows is it allows the garden to look nice and we can effectively use garden tools like the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Wheel Hoe</a> to cultivate in between the plants. There are a couple of techniques that you can use when trying to get that nice straight row for planting in the garden area. The first trick is by using a string and two stakes. So we place a stake on each end of the row and run the string between the stakes and tie it off. The strings sit about a foot above the soil or sometimes six inches and that indicates the straight row. Once you have the string ran along the row you can take a <a href=\"/products/field-hoe/\">hand hoe</a> and make a furrow to mark that row. Another way is if you have a <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> you can run the string between the handles and use that as a guide to making a straight row as you work down along the row. However, this string technique can be time-consuming because you have to move that string for every row that you are wanting to make straight. The technique that Travis prefers to use is for planting straight rows is by taking a <a href=\"/products/hoe-dag/\">little hand hoe</a> and scratching out a mark in the soil where he wants the beginning of the row to be. Then, he places a stake at the end of the row to drive towards. The trick to this technique is you never want to look down you always need to keep your eyes on what you are driving towards at the end of the row. Following this technique correctly will ensure that you get straight rows every time in the vegetable garden. Whether you use the string or drive towards a stake technique, planting straight rows in the garden are important to keep the garden nice, clean, and overall manageable for every growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YxqAwvp8sY&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:22-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Monogerm vs. Multigerm</h2>\nOn the week's episode, Travis explains the differences between monogerm and multigerm beet seeds. Beet seeds are naturally multigerm varieties which means that each seed contains more than one embryo. Multigerm seeds happen when flowers grow in clusters which in return produces multigerm seed balls. When the seed balls germinate they produce 2 to 5 seedlings at once. So when planting you will end up with more than one seedling or plant per seed which requires some form of thinning of the plants. The thinning is important to ensure we get large production and uniform beet seeds. For instance, with our beet seeds, we want the same size round beets all along the row in the vegetable garden. In order to get these results, the beets should be evenly spaced along the garden row so we have to thin those to ensure they are 4 to 6 inches apart in the vegetable garden. Due to the importance of the thinning process is one of the main reasons, Travis prefers to grow beets by transplant. It is much easier to do the thinning process in the greenhouse in the seed trays instead of waiting till they germinate in the vegetable garden. The natural multigerm beet seed that we carry is the <a href=\"/products/kestrel-beet/\">Kestrel variety</a>. These Kestrel beets are a hybrid variety that contains a nice disease resistance to downy mildew and powdery mildew. Monogerm means that each seed contains one seedling per seed or one plant per seed. So if you prefer to direct seed plants in the ground you should go with a monogerm variety like our <a href=\"/products/solo-beet/\">Solo beet</a> variety. This solo variety is another hybrid variety that contains great flavor profile and disease resistance from mildew, root rot, and Cercospora leaf spot. When planting this beet variety it allows you to plant them at the desired plant spacing and you do not have to worry about thinning them out in the garden as you do with multigerm seed varieties.\n<h2>Growing Beet Seeds</h2>\nThe best overall time to grow beets in the garden is during the spring and fall. They prefer to grow in soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5. If you tend to have heavy clay soils adding a good compost will help the beets grow better. When growing beet seeds they do best when transplanted using our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. Not only does it make thinning the beets easier if they need it but it also allows for better plant growth. If transplanting in the ground the preferred spacing is 4 inches along the row. However, they can be direct seeded in the vegetable garden with multiple rows close together and spaced as close to 6 inches apart. If direct seeding you can use our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> with the #3 seed plate to accurately plant the seeds in the garden rows. When it comes time for harvesting, beets are ready for harvest when the roots have reached around 3 to 4 inches in size. For storage purposes, you should remove the greens and store the beet roots for up to 2 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator. Some more great beet varieties that we carry are <a href=\"/products/merlin-beet/\">Merlin</a>, <a href=\"/products/touchstone-gold-beet/\">Touchstone Gold</a>, and <a href=\"/products/chioggia-beet/\">Chioggia</a>. One of the sweetest beets to grow in the vegetable garden is the Merlin beet due to its high sugar content. The Touchstone Gold beet is another flavorful beet that stands out with it's orange to gold skin and bright yellow flesh on the inside. While the Chioggia is an older heirloom variety with red and white bullseye design color contrast.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nDlNAka76c&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=6&amp;t=5s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:21-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing Tomato Plants</h2>\nThere are several reasons for planting tomato plants the right way in the garden. To avoid tomato plant mistakes growing them in seed trays instead of individual pots is a major priority. We recommend transplanting tomatoes because it allows us to get a jumpstart on the growing season that are ready to go in the ground as soon as the weather conditions are just right and grow stronger tomato plants. The soil conditions that tomato plants prefer to grow in is well-drained soils that provide plenty of sunlight. Since tomatoes are part of the nightshade family they are susceptible to blossom end rot. To avoid this problem applying a <a href=\"/products/pelletized-gypsum-soil-conditioner/\">Pelletized Gypsum Soil Conditioner</a> at the base of the tomato plant at bloom set will help with this end rot issue. The gypsum is a natural mineral that applies calcium and sulfur which are two important plant nutrients. We recommend when planting the tomatoes in the garden using either our heavy-duty <a href=\"/products/tomato-cages/\">tomato cages</a>, the Florida Weave technique with <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">Gro-Tie Garden Twine</a>, or the new <a href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-48-x-50/\">Hortonova trellis netting</a> to ensure the plants have support to grow off the ground and reduce the possibility of disease. We carry both hybrid and heirloom varieties of tomatoes. Some productive hybrid varieties that we offer that has high disease resistance traits such as <a href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\">Bella Rosa</a>, <a href=\"/products/sun-gold-tomato/\">Sun Gold</a>, <a href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\">Brickyard</a>, and <a href=\"/products/mountain-glory-tomato/\">Mountain Glory</a>. Some flavorful heirloom tomato varieties are <a href=\"/products/brandywine-pink-tomato/\">Brandywine</a>, <a href=\"/products/amish-paste-tomato/\">Amish Paste</a>, and <a href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\">Mortgage Lifter</a>. All of these tomato varieties have 70 days till they reach maturity and are ready for harvest.\n<h2>Avoid Tomato Plant Mistakes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains some mistakes that you should avoid with tomato plants. Travis has prepared the vegetable garden with <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> and good compost for the planting of tomatoes. There are a couple of key reasons why you should avoid tomato plant mistakes like bigger is not always better when growing tomato plants. The first reason for not creating larger tomato plants is to avoid transplant shock. For instance, when you have a little plant the smaller root ball will have an easier time adapting to the soil conditions and allow the plants to grow faster. Whereas the larger tomato plants that contain a larger root ball will struggle to adjust in the garden soil conditions and take longer to grow. The second key reason is depending on whether you are growing in the garden or a greenhouse we are all limited to some amount of space. With the <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> we can grow 162 tomato transplants that leave us with plenty of plants to continue growing in the garden. When growing tomato plants in big pots you lose space due to the number of large pots you will need for the garden. Also, with individual large pots, you will use a lot more potting soil than the seed starting trays. The third reason is due to the ease of transporting the plants to the garden area. With the seed trays, you can simply carry the tray with all the plants out to the garden and place them along the row. However, with the larger pots, they would be a hassle to get all the individual pots into the garden area. Another reason is when adding the transplants to the soil they simply pull out of the trays, while the plants in pots will take a tool to remove them and get rid of excess soil from the pots. Overall to avoid tomato plant mistakes grow your own tomato plants in the seed starting trays to save time, energy, and money in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hubGXdlOZtc&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=7&amp;t=3s",

    "title": "Why Good Compost is the Best Soil Amendment!",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:21-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why add good compost to the garden soil?</h2>\nTo increase the productivity, growth, and healthier plants in the vegetable garden adding the best soil amendment will leave your soil structure with so many benefits for many growing seasons. Using great compost contains four key components -- organic matter, moisture, bacteria, and oxygen. The organic matter provides the needed nitrogen and carbon sources for plant growth. While the moisture allows the compost to not dry out and the oxygen supports the breakdown of plant material. Then, the other microorganisms like bacteria will break down all the components and plant material into the useful compost material needed for the vegetable garden. When incorporating the compost in sandy soils it can increase the water-holding capacity, while in the heavier clay soils it can improve drainage. Another advantage of adding compost to the soil is the decrease in using so much fertilizer. When deciding whether to use compost or fertilizer in the garden it depends on which one you prefer more. Compost is an organic material that increases soil structure in the garden to create a more beneficial environment for the plants to grow. The fertilizers feed the plant directly which improves quicker plant growth in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Best Soil Amendment for the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains why good compost is the best soil amendment for the vegetable garden. In the garden, using good compost has many soil benefits such as providing plenty of nutrients into the soil so we don't have to use as many fertilizers in the vegetable garden. Another advantage is it will amend the soil perfectly to make the soil more workable by adding organic matter. A good quantity of compost has an adequate ratio of nitrogen and carbon. The nitrogen source comes from things like manure and the carbon source comes from decayed plant matter. We recommend using manure-based compost because it is overall rich in nitrogen and we can avoid using so much fertilizer in the vegetable garden. Travis gets his manure from a chicken house that provides plenty of nitrogen and works really well in the garden. When you get your compost for the garden you should cover it with a tarp to prevent it from drying out. If left uncovered the compost can dry out and be harder to apply or spread in your vegetable garden. When adding the good compost to the garden there are two techniques you can use. The first technique is spreading it over the entire garden. The second technique is using the FAD system and applying it just where you plant in the garden area. Depending on how chunky and hard the soil is to work in the garden it may be better to spread it over the entire garden area. However, if the soil tilth is nice and workable you can use the FAD system and just apply where the plants need it in the garden plot. When applying the FAD system we typically make a little furrow using the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and lay the compost down in the furrow and then cover it up. Next, we will plant right on top which will allow us to stretch the compost pile further and make the compost last longer. Also, it ensures that the compost is exactly where the plants need it and not wasted in other spaces such as walkways or edges in the garden. To ensure you have the best soil amendment in the garden, find you a good source of compost that will apply so many benefits for your plants in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9QexnKE30s&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=8&amp;t=5s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:21-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Early Spring Crop in the Vegetable Garden</h2>\nWhen looking at growing an early spring crop have you ever thought about green onions in the garden area? Green onions are immature little onions that are just starting the bulbing stage in the garden. Once they reach this stage they start to swell up a little bit and we will harvest a few of these small onions at this size. Then, leave the majority of the spring onions in the garden to get bigger then harvest them to dry out for onion storage. Green onions are smaller onions that are great for cooking in soups, salads, or even stir-fried. They also have a great flavor profile when eaten raw right after harvesting from the vegetable garden area. The green onions have a dark green stem and white bulb roots that are completely edible. They are ready to harvest out of the garden when they are tender, young, and the bulb has started to slightly swell. Typically the tops reach around 6 to 8 inches tall by this bulbing stage. To maintain the care of green onions much like spring onions they need plenty of water. The recommended way to supply water to the plant roots is by using drip tape because it applies water directly at the roots in the vegetable garden. The green onions are the same as spring onions they just are not fully mature. Spring onions are fully mature and have an onion bulb at the end of the plant. The spring onions also have a more defined flavor profile than the green onions in the vegetable garden. Deciding between harvesting spring onions or green onions is your personal preference because both offer exceptional flavor, different cooking techniques, storage methods, and harvesting times out of the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Growing Spring Crop: Green Onions</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks all about growing green onions withing in the vegetable garden. Travis currently has five rows of the Texas Legends onion and one row of the Red Creoles growing in the garden. These onion varieties are heavy feeders meaning they require a good amount of nutrients, fertilizer, and water supply to their plant roots. So we like to place the onions on a <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> irrigation system to ensure they obtain all the direct water source to the plant roots and provide healthy producing plants. The drip tape system will also help conserve water and save you time in the vegetable garden. Depending on how much water the onion obtains is how sweet the onion will end up tasting. When maintaining the weeds in the onion area, Travis likes to use the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> to go in between the double rows quickly to cultivate and weed the garden area. Then, after a couple of weeks, he likes to take his <a href=\"/products/short-single-tine-cultivator/\">Short Single Tine Cultivator</a> to work closely to remove weeds and cultivate around the onion plants. When Travis planted the onions in the garden he planted them on about 4-inch spacing to ensure there was plenty of green onions planted in the vegetable garden. Then, Travis prefers to go in the garden and pull out every other green onion for eating and provide more room for the rest of the spring onions to grow bulbs in the ground throughout the season. After harvesting the green onions they are stored best when covered and placed in the refrigerator for up to one or two weeks. When deciding what to plant for an early spring crop look at growing green onions or spring onions to get a bountiful harvest throughout the growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6dOrFE9HuY&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=9&amp;t=70s",

    "title": "Three Hybrid Tomato Varieties with Heirloom Flavor",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:20-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Hybrid vs. Heirloom Varieties</h2>\nIn the South, due to our high pest and disease pressure environment growing heirloom tomatoes can be difficult to grow in the vegetable garden. When discussing between hybrid and heirloom varieties there are major differences to take into account when thinking about planting one or the other variety. Heirloom or open-pollinated varieties contain seeds that will be passed down from one generation to another. While open-pollinated means those seeds can be saved and replanted the following years to come. Some heirloom varieties we carry are <a href=\"/products/amish-paste-tomato/\">Amish Paste</a>, <a href=\"/products/brandywine-pink-tomato/\">Brandywine</a>, and <a href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\">Mortgage Lifter</a>. These heirloom varieties usually contain an exceptional flavor profile but they are not as susceptible to pest and disease pressures and are not as productive as hybrid varieties. Hybrid seeds are produced by cross-pollinating two different plants of the same species together. Through hybridization, the pollination is controlled to obtain the correct cross of plants to achieve the desired traits or characteristics such as disease resistance, certain flavor profile, better yield, or early maturity dates. The hybrid varieties are more productive than heirlooms and more resistant to pest and disease pressures in the garden. However, these seeds cannot be saved or replanted the next year and may cost a little more due to the amount of productivity in the garden.\n<h2>Three Hybrid Tomato Varieties</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about hybrid tomato varieties that have the flavor profile of heirloom varieties but will work great in controlling pest and disease pressure areas. Some diseases like the tomato spotted wilt virus and tobacco mosaic virus will demolish our tomato plants quickly in the garden area. However, three hybrid tomato varieties that we recommend growing due to there high disease resistance, increasing yield, and great flavor profile is the <a href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\">Bella Rosa</a>, <a href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\">Brickyard</a>, and <a href=\"/products/mountain-glory-tomato/\">Mountain Glory</a>. The Bella Rosa is a seed that produces large and firm fruits with exceptional flavor. Travis has grown this variety for several years and with our southern climates, we have had no trouble and always get maximum production and a great flavor profile from this Bella Rosa. The Mountain Glory is another hybrid variety that has exceptional heirloom flavor profile and excellent disease resistance in the vegetable garden. The last hybrid tomato variety that Travis talks about is the Brickyard. If there is any type of tomato disease out there it's more than likely the Brickyard is highly resistant to it. These three hybrid tomato varieties all come in pelleted seed form meaning the seed has been coated with clay to make it larger and round so it is easier to singulate for planting in <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. When transplanting in the seed starting trays you are able to get a jumpstart on the growing season and better overall transplants that will produce higher quality plants to go in the vegetable garden. We recommend planting in the seed starting trays because you can place them directly into the ground instead of having to place them in larger pots. Travis explains that the only time he will place them into large pots, is if the transplants are ready for the ground but the weather temperatures are still too cold outside to plant tomatoes. Once planted in the ground we prefer using the <a href=\"\">Florida Weave technique</a> to ensure enough support for the heavy producing tomato plants to grow upright in the garden. So when looking to grow tomatoes in your high humidity and pest/disease pressure area, try out these three hybrid tomato varieties that can withstand those high pressures and leave you with great flavor profiles and maximum production in the vegetable garden.\n\n&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=10&amp;t=0s\n            <div class=\"video-container\">\n              <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8BwVs8W2RkM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n            </div>\n          ",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:20-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Collard Varieties in the Garden</h2>\nAlthough collards have been a staple in the South throughout several years, collards have become increasingly popular around the world. In the past, Travis has tried growing several different collard varieties such as the Top Bunch, Champion, and Vates. However, the most productive collard variety and his favorite is the <a href=\"/products/tiger-collard/\">Tiger Collard</a>. The tiger collard is a hybrid variety that produces upright stalks that yield quick and early in the garden. Collards are champions of the frost meaning they can withstand some of the coldest weather environments. Another advantage of growing collards is they are bolt-resistant in the heat so they can be grown throughout many growing seasons leaving a productive continuous harvest in the vegetable garden. Whether you are direct seeding with our <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/seeders/home/\">garden seeder</a> or transplanting with the seed starting tray, Tiger Collards are the most productive crop to grow in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Growing Collards for Multiple Harvests</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks all about the most productive collard variety that we grow in the vegetable garden. Due to the continuous amount of harvest you can receive over the long growing season, it makes collards the most productive out of a lot of the other crops. With collards being extremely frost tolerant and resistant to bolting they work great for planting in the fall and growing throughout the entire winter and on into some of the warmer months. However, if you prefer to get a one time harvest on collards you can do so by cutting off the base of the plant. Travis prefers to get a continuous harvest off of them and will harvest them similar to his <a href=\"/products/lacinato-kale/\">Lacinato kale</a> by plucking the bottom leaves off the stalk and leave a few leaves at the top. When growing the most productive collard variety, Tiger Collard, we start by growing them in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. We recommend starting them in the seed starting trays because they will germinate quicker and produce a higher quality transplant for the garden. In the vegetable garden, Travis planted a single row of Tiger collards in the fall that has been harvested around 5 or 6 times already. For the spring growing season, he wants to plant a double row of Tiger collards so he will have a continuous harvest for the warmer months. To start planting the collards he begins with the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> to create a furrow for the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a> to be buried in the middle of the plants. Then, with the double wheel hoe and the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer Attachment</a>, he laid the tape in the furrow. Next, he wanted the transplants to be planted in a double row so each plant should be planted on each side of the drip tape in the middle. When planting the transplants on the first row he recommends planting the transplants alongside the drip tape about a foot apart. Then for the second row of the double row, he staggers the plants in between the plants on the first part of the double row. After a few weeks and the transplants are settled in the garden, Travis begins applying fertilizer through the drip irrigation and side dressing with some <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a>. The Chilean Nitrate fertilizer is an organic nitrate-nitrogen source that contains many essential nutrients that vegetables need throughout the plant growth stages in the garden. Overall, if you want to maximize the garden space and get an increasing continuous harvest throughout many months try growing the most productive collard variety such as the Tiger Collard in the upcoming growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjWrFo7jBTQ&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=11&amp;t=11s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:17-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Watermelon Radishes vs. Traditional Radishes</h2>\nDuring the spring and fall, a fun and easy crop to grow in the garden are <a href=\"/products/watermelon-radish/\">watermelon</a> radishes. They get the name watermelon radish due to their creamy-white exterior with a bright purple to a pinkish interior that resembles more of a watermelon figure. Although they look similar to traditional radishes from the exterior there are a couple of differences when comparing traditional radishes to watermelon radishes in the vegetable garden. The first difference is unlike traditional radish varieties, the watermelon radishes contain more of a firm and milder flavor profile that is great to eat raw or sauteed up in a pan when cooking. Another major difference is the size between the two different varieties. A traditional radish variety has a tendance to split once they get bigger and are left in the garden for too long. While the watermelon radish variety can be grown up to the size of a tennis ball and will not split like a normal traditional radish.  Some similarities between the watermelon radish and traditional radish varieties are they grow best in cooler weather with well-drained soils so they should be planted when temperatures are cooler. Once done harvesting, the radish tops should be removed and they will last for up to two weeks in the fridge.\n<h2>Hoss Garden Seeder: Planting Watermelon Radishes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about planting watermelon radishes with our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Garden Seeder</a>. The garden seeder is the perfect tool to accomplish this task because it comes with six adjustable seed plates that are modified for various different seed sizes. For example, the #1 seed plate can fit seeds like cauliflower, broccoli, or turnips. The #2 seed plate fits small coated seeds like onions and the #3 seed plate fits pelleted carrots, lettuce, and beets. The #4 seed plate does best with small sweet corn seeds. While the #5 seed place does better with small pea and bean seeds. Lastly, the #6 seed plate can fit large sweet and field corn seeds. Not only do the seed plates make planting easier but it also allows for accurate planting without overplanting in the vegetable garden. Due to the size of the seed, watermelon radishes work in the #1 or #2 seed plate with a little drilling to make the seed fit perfectly. The #1 seed plate has eight holes so that gives you a little over two-inch spacing. However, we need to plant watermelon radishes a little further apart so Travis will go in and thin every other one of the small radishes then let the rest get a decent size. Then, all Travis has to do is walk behind the Hoss garden seeder and plant the watermelon radishes between 6 to 8 inches apart in the row. In the past, he has planted the watermelon radishes on double rows with <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> buried in the middle and that works really well because the plants are receiving water directly to the plant roots. Due to the garden area layout, he decided to only plant four rows on the edge of the garden so he could just hand water these plants instead. However, these radishes perform best when planted in double rows or a \"bed\" with several rows planted closely together in the vegetable garden. Watermelon radishes are direct-seeded because they seem to perform better in the garden than transplanting. If you haven't tried growing watermelon radishes in the Hoss garden seeder before, you should definitely give it a try it will be a fun and easy crop to grow throughout the spring and fall growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlYbZZNpN04&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=12&amp;t=20s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Maximizing Your Garden Space</h2>\nIf you struggle with a little amount of garden space to grow a variety of vegetables in the garden you have to find clever methods to improve your growing area. Using the straddle weeding technique allows for planting on tight row spacing. While the Floride weave technique or the <a href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-48-x-50/\">Hortonova Trellis Netting</a> provides the opportunity to grow crops vertically instead of on the ground which saves you plenty of room in the garden area. Planting in <a href=\"/products/48-raised-bed-kit/\">raised beds</a> instead of continuous garden rows will also save space inside the garden area. If you would like to get more production of plants, growing crops that you can succession plant all throughout the season will save space and time in the vegetable garden as well.\n<h2>Staddle Weeding Technique</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks all about how to maximize garden spacing with the straddle weeding technique in the smaller garden areas. By using either our <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> or <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> these tools allow us to use the straddle weeding technique in the vegetable garden. What it means to straddle weeding is to take one of these wheel hoe tools and straddle the row of plants to cultivate or weed on both sides of the row in one pass through. This technique allows you to either weed or cultivate close to those plants. It also might throw a little soil to the plants to encourage some root development. In the garden, Travis planted several rows of beets with our <a href=\"/products/row-maker/\">row maker</a> tool. The row maker creates planting furrows in the soil for easier row spacing and planting by direct seed or transplant. He planted the beets on single rows with tight spacing only 1-foot apart. This ensures that Travis will get maximum garden space and provide him the opportunity to use the straddle weeding technique withing in the garden area. With both the double wheel hoe and high arch wheel hoe there are several different attachments and options that you can use for this weeding technique. The first setup is using our <a href=\"/products/spreader-bar-bonus/\">spreader bar bonus</a>. This spreader bar bonus includes the spreader bar and two of our 6-inch <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\">oscillating hoes</a>. By placing the oscillating hoes on the far end of the bar this can be mounted on the wheel hoe to use to straddle the row of plants while the oscillating hoes cultivate on both sides of the plant in the garden. The next option is to use the <a href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\">cultivator teeth</a> that are included with every wheel hoe. With this attachment, you place the cultivator teeth behind each wheel on the wheel hoe and that allows you to throw soil more than the oscillating hoe in order to hill the plants. The third attachment that is used for the straddle weeding technique is our new <a href=\"/products/winged-sweeps/\">winged sweeps</a> attachment. The winged sweeps are available in a four-inch and six-inch blade. Similar to the cultivator teeth set-up, Travis likes to place them behind each wheel but a little to the outside of the wheel. This attachment allows you to dig a little deeper than the cultivator teeth attachment. On the double wheel hoe, there is a 5 or 6-inch clearance area on the axle. While the high arch wheel hoe has about a 15-inch clearance area which helps when the plants get a lot taller throughout there growing time in the vegetable garden. The straddle weeding technique helps to keep the vegetable garden nicely cultivated, clean, and a weed free area. As well as, save you plenty of space if you have a tighter garden area to work in.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIkZSkup7o&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=13&amp;t=29s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:16-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Bok Choy Benefits in the Garden</h2>\nUnlike your traditional red or green cabbage that forms big heads and is used in soups and salads, an uncommon and different type of cabbage is Bok Choy. Also, known as Pak Choy or Pok Choy depending on what area of the world it is being grown. Bok Choy falls under the Chinese cabbage category but does not taste like regular cabbage. This type of crop is also categorized under cruciferous vegetable meaning that it provides many valuable nutrients. Bok Choy provides many nutrients such as vitamin C, protein, calcium, iron, dietary fiber, etc. Like most other vegetables it ensures a good source of fiber. This crop tastes more like a mustard green but with a milder flavor profile. The texture is a little crisp but much more tender than regular white and red cabbage. With crops like mustard, turnips, or collards we usually remove the stem before cooking them because the stem is tough and not palatable. However, with this type of cabbage variety, you can eat the whole plant. The white stems on the plant are tender and great to use for cooking. Bok Choy can be eaten in many different ways such as salads, coleslaw, soups, stir-fried, grilled, or as a garnish. To fill your garden with a variety of nutrient and fibrous plants try growing Bok Choy in the next early spring and fall season.\n<h2>Growing Bok Choy</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks all about growing Bok Choy in the vegetable garden. As for growing Bok Choy, they can be grown two different ways in the vegetable garden. You can harvest them as baby greens or let them continue to grow to full size. When growing the baby greens they should be direct-seeded really densely on a bed that's around two or two and a half foot wide. Once the leaves start to form then the leaves are simply cut off to harvest. This type of crop allows for a continuous harvest all throughout the growing season. If you prefer to grow the full-size florets they need a little bit more space in the garden area. Travis likes to transplant these in the <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. The seed starting trays have a verticle root training ribs that help with aeration and root ball draining of plant roots. We prefer to transplant seeds because we can get a jumpstart on the growing season and it improves the production of healthier plants for the vegetable garden. When transplanting them in the trays they only take about 3 to 4 weeks to emerge and be ready to go in the ground. Once the transplants are placed in the garden we put them on a double row with drip irrigation buried in the middle. The <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> should be used to accurately apply water and nutrients directly to the plant roots. Placing the plants about 8 inches apart along the row will allow for plenty of room to grow. Bok Choy tends to grow quickly and only takes 50 days to mature in the vegetable garden. The Bok Choy that we grow is <a href=\"/products/joi-choi-chinese-cabbage/\">Joi Choi</a> which is a hybrid variety with an excellent mild flavor and great production. Producing 10 to 14 stalks per plant and each stalk reaching 8 to 10 inches long. If you are looking to grow a different type of green that is easy to grow and cold hardy, the Boy Choy is a great choice for the vegetable garden. Compared to other greens, it is heat-tolerant and slow to bolt in the spring season with warmer temperatures.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5NU51tL2QU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=14&amp;t=45s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:16-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing Lettuce in the Garden</h2>\nInstead of buying the bland lettuce at the grocery store, you should try growing your own healthy lettuce in the vegetable garden. The perfect time to grow lettuce is between the fall and winter because weather conditions are just right. With cooler temperatures, these excellent varieties of lettuce are less likely to bolt in the vegetable garden. This allows us to not only have a continuous harvest throughout the growing season but we can succession plant lettuce as well. For succession planting we usually plant a new crop of lettuce in the ground around every 4 weeks this ensures us lettuce all throughout the wintertime. We begin growing lettuce by transplanting in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. Once they start to emerge in the tray we thin them to one plant per cell. Typically these excellent varieties of lettuce take 3 to 4 weeks before they are ready to be transplanted into the garden area. When they become ready to plant in the garden we prefer to plant them in double rows with <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> buried in the middle. We use drip irrigation to provide all the water and nutrients directly to the plant roots. We space the lettuce transplants about 8 inches apart along the row because once the heads get larger they will cover that entire area. Lettuce varieties require an adequate amount of fertilization to supply the plants with nutrients for healthy growth. If they do not get enough plant nutrients the lettuce will end up turning a yellow color and will not form large solid heads. We recommend injecting some <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> into our drip system that is buried beside of lettuce transplants. The 20-20-20 is a water-soluble fertilizer that has the three major macronutrients that plants need -- phosphorous, nitrogen, and potassium. We can also side-dress them with <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a> so we apply it alongside the plant row. Chilean Nitrate is an organic nitrate nitrogen nutrient source that contains micronutrients such as iodine and selenium. Then, take our Wheel Hoe to incorporate it along beside the lettuce plants in the vegetable garden. By applying the accurate amount of fertilizer and water to plants it ensures that we will get healthy productive lettuce all throughout the growing season.\n<h2>Excellent Varieties of Lettuce</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about his favorite lettuce varieties to grow in the vegetable garden. If you are getting tired of eating the same iceberg lettuce from the grocery store, you should branch out and try a new variety of lettuce. Travis has two excellent varieties of lettuce that are packed full of flavor and nutrients. The <a href=\"/products/parris-island-romaine/\">Parris Island Romaine</a> is a productive and flavorful heirloom variety. It works great for baby-leaf harvests, but also produce heavy upright heads that can get around 12 inches tall. Travis's next variety of lettuce that he loves to grow is <a href=\"/products/butter-crunch-lettuce/\">Butter Crunch</a>. This variety works great in salads and wraps because it contains a smooth, buttery texture and flavor profile. They have soft large heads that are best consumed shortly after harvest. Another lettuce variety we like to grow is the pelleted, <a href=\"/products/skyphos-butterhead-lettuce/\">Skyphos Butterhead Lettuce</a>. This is a red butterhead variety that has a dark red exterior with green interior. It also has great texture and flavor profile with disease-resistance to downy mildew and lettuce mosaic virus. A few other lettuce varieties we offer are <a href=\"/products/calshot-romaine-lettuce/\">Calshot Romaine</a>, <a href=\"/products/harmony-butterhead-lettuce/\">Harmony Butterhead</a>, <a href=\"/products/starfighter-lettuce/\">Starfighter</a>, <a href=\"/products/salad-bowl-red-lettuce/\">Salad Bowl Red</a>, and <a href=\"/products/black-seeded-simpson-lettuce/\">Black Seeded Simpson</a>. The Calshot, Harmony, and Starfighter lettuce are all pelleted seeds which makes it easier for planting in seed trays. All of these excellent varieties of lettuce will supply your garden with productive and healthy plants.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJk0kuLRzYE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=15&amp;t=46s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Maintaining Garden Tools</h2>\nIn order to ensure you have long-lasting garden tools, it is important to properly take care of them when not using them in the vegetable garden. To keep them from losing their effectiveness and sharpness over time we should spend a little time to properly maintain the conditioning of them by sharpening, removing the rust, and store them away in a proper location. The first step in ensuring they remain taken care of is putting them away once you are done using them in the garden. In order to remove rust and keep them sharp, you can use our Farmers File has an essential tool for maintaining your everyday gardening tools. Overall, in order to keep your tools in pristine condition take some time in the barn by properly cleaning and sharpening the edges to keep them lasting a lifetime.\n<h2>Best Sharpening Tool for Garden Tools</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about how to prepare the garden tools for the upcoming growing season. During the winter months, when the gardening season is slower this is the perfect time to work on preparing your tools for the spring growing season. Travis has his long-handled <a href=\"/products/long-batwing-hoe/\">Batwing Hoe</a> that is one of his favorite general hoes around the garden area. The batwing hoe contains a rounded sharp edge that makes removing large weeds and adding or removing soil to plants. For example, it can be used to add soil to crops like corn or potatoes for hilling and stabilizing plant stems.  We also offer a <a href=\"/products/small-batwing-hoe/\">small-handled batwing hoe</a> version for using in raised beds. To remove any kind of rust and sharpen the garden tool we recommend using our <a href=\"/products/farmers-file/\">Farmers File</a>. The farmers file is an all-around general purpose tool that will keep your tools sharpened for maximum potential. This garden tool works great on almost any kind of surfaces such as metal, iron bar, stainless steel, plastics, and wood. Containing two sides the farmer file has a double cut and a single cut side. The double cut side is used to remove rust and excess material. While the single cut side is used for the final polishing and getting those garden tools really sharp. Travis begins preparing the garden tool by placing the batwing in a vice to hold the blade still while sharpening. Starting with the double cut side he pushes it up along the blade to remove the rust. By keeping the right angle you can tell whether or not it's taking off the rust from the garden tool. Be sure to never drag the farmer file backward because it can ruin the file, so always push the file in a forward motion on the sharp edge. Then using the single cut side of the farmer file we will fine-tune the blade and get in nice and sharp. Once he is done with the curved side of the blade where most of the filling is done, Travis likes to take the single cut side and run it over the flat edge of the blade. This will add the finishing touches to the sharp blade. After the blade is taking care of he moves on to taking care of the batwing hoe handle. Travis takes some boiled linseed oil to pour on an old rag and evenly apply it along the long handle. This will help condition and protect the handle to make it nice, smooth, and easy to use in the vegetable garden. So next time you have some downtime in the garden take advantage of this time by preparing your gardening tools for the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de5mCl_W1V4&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=16&amp;t=69s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:15-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What is Elephant Garlic?</h2>\nUnlike the traditional garlic varieties, Elephant garlic is actually more related to a leek that has the look, taste, and easy to grow like garlic. Elephant garlic gets its name due to the large size it obtains that is twice the size of regular garlic. Containing a hardy bulb the elephant garlic typically has 5 to 6 individual large cloves that grow up to around 3 feet from bulb to the tip of the garlic. These individual cloves can be used to replant elephant garlic in the next growing season. When growing elephant garlic it is a heavy feeder crop much like carrots or cabbage that needs plenty of water and nutrients for sufficient growth in the vegetable garden. Once elephant garlic leaves start turning a yellowish or brown color they are ready for harvest. To store elephant garlic they should be placed underneath a cool and shaded area that provides plenty of aeration. These crops can store for up to 8 to 10 months in well prepared storing conditions. If you have not tried growing elephant garlic we recommend trying it out in the vegetable garden especially in you live in the deep south and have experienced no luck growing traditional garlic varieties.\n<h2>Replanting Elephant Garlic</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis identifies tricks to save your elephant garlic to plant year after year. Due to our weather conditions in the deep South, we have a hard time growing traditional garlic such as the soft neck or hard neck varieties. So instead of the traditional garlic varieties, we stick to growing elephant garlic because it does well here in the South. Elephant garlic seed stocks tend to be pricy and really hard to get so we prefer to replant elephant garlic from last year's season. In the last spring when we harvest our elephant garlic we store it underneath the barn to dry out like we do our onions. Throughout the year we will consume a little bit the elephant garlic but save some as well for planting next winter. When we get ready to plant the elephant garlic we simply break apart the bulbs into individual cloves and that is what we plant in the garden area. To prepare the garden for replanting elephant garlic you should make a small trench or furrow to plant the garlic cloves. Travis likes to use his <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">Plow Set</a> attachment in the furrowing position. He makes rows that are around 3 to 4 inches deep to plant the garlic cloves in the furrow. Then he walks along the row placing the garlic cloves 8 to 10 inches apart in the furrow with the pointed end up. Then, Travis took the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> with the plow set attached in the hilling position he straddles the row of garlic cloves and covers them up. Due to garlic being related to onions they are heavy feeders that require an accurate amount of water and nutrients to the plant roots. Once the garlic leaves emerge from the soil, applying plenty of water and fertilizer is key to the success of growing big bulbs for replanting elephant garlic next year. We use our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation</a> for heavy-feeder crops like garlic because it applies water directly to the plant roots in the vegetable. We can also use the drip irrigation to feed the plant roots with a water-soluble fertilizer like <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> to give the elephant garlic plenty of nutrients. For replanting elephant garlic it is important to effectively plant them in the garden in order to produce big bulbs that can be used year after year.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdjdsYhuDFc&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=17&amp;t=25s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:15-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Most Underrated Cold Weather Crop</h2>\nThe Purple Vienna and White Vienna Kohlrabi are two varieties of Kohlrabi that have productive yields and are the most underrated cold weather staple crops to grow during the cooler seasons. During the Fall and Winter months, Kohlrabi takes 45 days to maturity which works great for succession planting because you are able to get a continuous harvest and they typically grow up to 12 inches tall with edible greens and bulbs. When Kohlrabi bulbs reach about 3 inches in diameter that's when it's time to harvest. The <a href=\"/products/purple-vienna-kohlrabi/\">Purple Vienna Kohlrabi</a> is a productive heirloom variety that contains purple bulbs. While the <a href=\"/products/white-vienna-kohlrabi/\">White Vienna Kohlrabi</a> is similar to the Purple Vienna, instead of purple it has light green bulbs and leaves. When preparing Kohlrabi to eat raw in slaw or salad, you should peel the bulb due to the outside being tough and not pleasant to taste.\n<h2>What is Kohlrabi?</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about the most underrated cold weather crop that we grow in the vegetable garden. Kohlrabi is becoming one of Travis's favorite cool weather crops to grow in the vegetable garden. Known as a Brassica, kohlrabi is related to crops like Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, and collards. The two edible parts of kohlrabi are the leaves and the bulb. Once you peel away the purple flesh of the bulb it will be white on the inside and have a texture similar to turnip roots. The flavor is similar to cabbage and some people even say it taste like a raw cucumber. To cook them you can cut them up and stir-fry them, but Travis likes to just eat them raw. For example, you can make coleslaw or salad out of them or just add salt and pepper to eat them raw. To plant kohlrabi you can either direct seed or transplant them. When direct seeding we use the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> to make planting quick and easy in the vegetable garden. The garden seeder comes with 6 seed plates that have already been drilled out to fit the various vegetable seed sizes. The #1 seed plate has a modified hole size to fit the Kohlrabi seeds perfectly. Travis prefers to transplant them because they seem to do much better in the garden that way and it allows us to get a jumpstart on the growing season. When transplanting Kohlrabi we recommend planting 3 to 4 weeks before the desired planting date. Similar to other cool weather crops, Travis plants the Kohlrabi transplants on double rows with drip irrigation in the middle. To lay the drip irrigation, he uses our <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer Attachment</a> and <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">Plow Set</a>. This attachment helps turn normally a two-person job into a one-person job and makes it easier to lay straight rows of drip tape in the garden area. We use the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> system to ensure that crops are accurately getting all the water they need directly to the plant roots. Another advantage of having buried drip tape is we conserve water and reduce pest, disease, and weed pressures, unlike overhead watering and hand watering in the vegetable garden. Kohlrabi plants do not need a lot of space to grow so Travis typically plants them 8 to 10 inches apart along the row. As the most underrated cool weather crop with little space to grow Kohlrabi is perfect to grow if you have a smaller garden area with not a lot of room to grow plants. If you want to try growing the most underrated cold weather crop, Kohlrabi would be a great crop to add a unique vegetable to try out in the vegetable garden this season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENNpUOoBj98&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=18&amp;t=0s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Broadleaf Mustard</h2>\nGrown in the Fall or early Spring, <a href=\"/products/broadleaf-mustard/\">Broadleaf Mustard</a> is the best crop for managing soil pests. Known as a cool season cover crop it contains a chemical compound called glucosinolate, that allows it to decrease several common pests and diseases from the garden. Another benefit this cover crop has to offer is it can suppress nematode populations and soil fungi. Broadleaf mustard contains a significant amount of biomass that increases organic matter in the soil which is important for erosion control. Erosion control will prevent water runoff and reduce nutrient leaking in heavy rainfalls. Similar to other cover crops, mustard contains a taproot system that extends deep into bottom soil layers that help serve to loosen hard clay soils. When loosening these hard soils it improves aeration and soil drainage in the vegetable garden. Improving the aeration of the soil allows for air, water, and nutrients to reach the plant roots that grow in the soil and make the nutrients accessible to the plants. With proper aeration, this also helps soil drainage in the garden. With accurate soil drainage, this will decrease soil and nutrients from being lost to runoff and avoid soil erosion. Broadleaf mustard is our go-to crop when controlling soil pests and increasing our overall soil structure in the vegetable garden. Two other cover crops that help control soil pests are <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> and <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>.\n<h2>Controlling Soil Pests</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains ways to control soil pests that are disturbing your vegetable garden. He recently planted Broadleaf mustard in his garden using the <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/seeders/home/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. The garden seeder has adjustable planting depth and premade seed plates that allow you to easily plant a variety of vegetable plants. Leaving the mustard to grow a couple of months it ended up producing a great cover crop that covered the garden area nicely. In order to use this cover crop effectively for biofumigation, we have to cut up the mustard leaves and incorporate it back into the soil. When the leaves are cut or ground up that's when they release the chemicals for bio-fumigation to control soil pests like nematode populations. The chemical compounds are glucosinolates that are converted into sulfur compounds known as thiocyanates. The thiocyanates will actually apply the biofumigation technique to the nematode populations in the vegetable garden. Many researchers have done studies that explain when incorporating the biofumigation technique into the soil the most effective way is when the soil is a little moist or wet in the garden. This technique should also be done before the mustard plant goes to seeds. Wait until the mustard produces a good amount of leaves to ensure you get an effective amount of biomass, but incorporate them back into the soil before they produce any seeds so you avoid weed problems in the vegetable garden. The broadleaf mustard is edible to harvest and eat but our main goal was to increase the biomass in the soil so we incorporated all of the mustard back into the soil instead of harvesting it. Along with the biofumigant properties, the broadleaf mustard has the ability to effectively suppress weeds and control erosion. When mustard is planted densely in the garden it will shade out any new weed development and protect the garden area from erosion problems. If you are looking for a crop that will help control soil pests like nematode populations, suppress weed germination, control soil erosion, and even incorporate a nice green organic matter back into the soil a cover crop such as Broadleaf mustard will work perfectly to ensure an efficient and effective vegetable garden for the next growing season.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDrriS7O7f0&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=19&amp;t=5s",

    "title": "Cultivating the Garden After Heavy Rains",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:14-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Cultivating the Garden Area</h2>\nThe overall reason for cultivating the garden area is to improve the soil for the next crop planting. Cultivating the garden allows you to break up the soil surface to enhance better penetration of water, air, and nutrients in the soil that plants need access to for all stages of growth. Penetrating air will improve the micro-organisms in the soil structure and increase soil nutrients plant growth in all stages of life. Another advantage of cultivating the garden is it makes it easier for newly germinated seeds to come up in the soil surface. Although it does bring weed seeds to the top of the soil it will also pull young seedlings to the soil surface and if left exposed they will die off. The most important reason for reducing weed germination is the decrease in competition between weeds and plants for nutrients and water. The importance of suppressing weeds is so the plants do not have to fight for the water and nutrients that they need to grow in the vegetable garden. Cultivating the garden area will allow for easier workable soil and an increase of healthier and productive crops in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Reasons to Cultivate After Heavy Rainfalls</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis discusses how to cultivate the garden area after a heavy amount of rainfall. After heavy rains, typically your soil is leveled out and packed down in the garden. This can cause an issue with weed control and soil crusting. With flattened or compacted soil this will increase weed germination because of the amount of moisture that is in the soil. We recommend keeping the top couple of inches cultivated to avoid those weeds germinating. The second reason for cultivating the soils after heavy rain is to avoid soil crusting. Even in sandy loam soils if we let the soil sit for several days we will get crusting on the top of the soil that will make it harder to cultivate for the garden rows. So in order to prevent weed germination and soil crusting we should begin cultivating the garden as soon as we can after the hard rainfall. Travis's general rule of thumb when determining when it's safe to cultivate in the garden is by stepping out into the garden and if his feet don't sink in the soil it's ready to cultivate. The preferred tool he likes to use for cultivating after heavy rain is the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> with <a href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\">three cultivator teeth</a>. This makes it easy to just go along the garden rows and scratch the soil and break up the soil crust. Cultivating the first couple of inches of soil will also help to aerate the soil and let it dry out better so the garden doesn't stay wet for a prolonged period of time. We prefer to use the wheel hoe to cultivate after heavy rains over a tiller or tractor because it is lightweight, strong, and more manageable. We avoid frequent use of the tiller in the garden because it can destroy our soil structure and increase our weed germination. In order to maintain a healthy soil structure in the garden, we avoid frequent use of the tiller to help from disrupting and compacting the soil. The increase of weeds is because when tilling the soil we flip the bottom soil over and allow for weed seeds to be exposed and obtain moisture to germinate in the vegetable garden. Overall, cultivating the garden after a lot of rain will ensure that you maintain weed control and keep your soil surface workable in the future.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C30e49srDfc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=20&amp;t=32s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Why Remove Weeds in the Garden?</h2>\nWeeds are a commonly known issue for every homeowner, business property, and home garden. The are several important reasons for removing thick weeds in the vegetable garden. The major reason to remove pesky weeds from the garden is they steal nutrients and water from the soil and plants. The soil in the garden contains nutrients and holds water for plants to gather up to grow in the garden. Unfortunately, having weeds in the garden they will steal all of these nutrients and water from the plant and cause major problems. Not only do they steal nutrients and water they also are home for the pests that are snacking away at your plants. They can also get in the way when trying to harvest vegetables in the garden. If you are experiencing high weed pressures in the garden we recommend planting cover crops that will suppress these pressures. Many cover crops such as <a href=\"/products/winter-rye/\">Winter Rye</a>, <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a>, <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>, <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a>, and <a href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\">Daikon Radish</a> will all do an excellent job at suppressing weed pressures in the vegetable garden. Some of these cover crops will also help with erosion control, reduce pest pressures, and build up your soil structure. Eliminating weeds will ensure for an easy crop turnover and a clean prepared area to plant your next crop in the vegetable garden. Another way to decrease weed pressures is by using <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a>. Drip irrigation allows for the water to go directly to the plant roots, unlike other irrigation methods. With overhead watering, you are unnecessarily watering areas in the garden that do not need water and this will increase weed germination. Don't forget to use proper techniques when trying to remove these pesky weeds in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Best Tool For Crop Turnover</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains his favorite tool to use for crop turnover in the vegetable garden. In the garden, Travis previously had some okra plants, but after experiencing our first frost of the season the okra plants were done growing and he removed them from the vegetable garden. Using our Wheel Hoe we were able to control most of the weeds between the rows. However, long-term crops like okra you are prone to have weed pressures along the row between the okra stalks. In order to get rid of these thick patches of weeds so we can start preparing this area for the next crop, we plan to plant there in that spot. Our favorite tool for removing these weeds and crop turnover is the <a href=\"/products/diamond-hoe/\">Diamond Hoe</a>. This long handle tool contains a head that is shaped like a diamond with sharp edges on all four sides. As well as two points on the ends that allow you to dig deeper if you need to. When using the diamond hoe it will sit flat on the soil surface which allows you to move it back and forth and cut out all the weeds between rows and along the row. You simply move the hoe backward and forward along the soil surface and to all sides being sharp it cuts weeds in all directions. Once we cut all those weeds on top the soil we just leave them to dry out and die then come in with our <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">dura rake</a> and clean the area up. This allows for an easy crop turnover and nice clean area for replanting in the vegetable garden. It is no doubt that if need a tool for quick and easy crop turnover the diamond hoe will do the trick for clearing weeds and helping you clean the area for the next crop to be planted in the vegetable garden.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/epb_IgB1aMQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=21&amp;t=63s",

    "title": "Simple Drip Irrigation System for Your Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:14-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Simple Drip Irrigation System</h2>\nIt is a known fact that drip irrigation should be used in your garden because it reduces disease and weed pressures. Another advantage of having simple drip irrigation is it conserves water because you are not wasting water applying to the edges of the garden and in between rows of plants through overhead watering. If you are new to drip tape we offer a <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">Drip Tape Irrigation Kit</a> that has everything to get you started in the vegetable garden. Within the irrigation kit, we offer a filter regulator combo, 100-foot mainline tubing role, 1640 foot 8 mil drip tape roll, hole punch, mainline tee, 2 figure 8 clamps, 2 mainline couplings, 20 drip tape row starts, 20 drip tape row ends, 4 drip tape couplings, and 10 goof plugs. We highly recommend burying drip tape in the garden to get the most effective results. Our drip tape can be buried up to 6 inches deep and can be reused for a few growing seasons in the vegetable garden. Burying the drip tape also allows it to stay in place, decrease damage from pests, and you can direct seed on top of it with our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>.\n<h2>Setting Up Drip Irrigation in the Garden</h2>\nSimilar to all other irrigation methods you have a well or your water source and a water hose that runs from that water source to the vegetable garden. Once you are at the garden plot, your simple drip irrigation system will start with the <a href=\"/products/filter-regulator-combo/\">Filter Regulator Combo</a>. This filter regulator contains many parts that easily connect your water hose and your mainline tubing for the drip tape. The first piece contains a pressure regulator that helps reduce the water down to 12 PSI which is exactly what the drip system needs. Next, you have a drip irrigation filter that catches any kind of hard debris matter from entering into the drip tape and clogging it up. Then on each end, you have a 3/4 inch hose screen with a swivel that connects the 5/8 inch mainline tubing to the drip tape system. While the other end has a brass hose swivel that easily attaches your standard 3/4 inch water hose to the filter regulator combo. You can add this filter regulator combo at the end of the garden to feed in one direction. However, Travis has found that adding the filter regulator combo to the middle of your garden is much better because you get equal distribution of water to all your drip lines. Travis likes to cut around 2 to 3-inches long off the <a href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\">mainline tubing</a> then place it on the filter regulator and add the <a href=\"/products/mainline-tee/\">mainline tee</a>. The mainline tee allows you to split one mainline section into two mainline sections. With this set up it makes for a simple drip irrigation system in the middle of the garden area. Lastly, when you are ready to plant add the drip tape perpendicular to the mainline tubing. Travis prefers to lay his drip tape with our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer attachment</a> on the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">Plow Set</a>. This makes it easy and quick to lay the drip tape in the garden as a one-person job. Next, apply the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-start-valve/\">drip tape row start valves</a> to connect the tape in the row to the mainline of tubing. While the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-end/\">row end valves</a> will seal off the rows of the drip tape and the <a href=\"/products/figure-8-end-clamp/\">figure 8 end clamps</a> will seal off the end of the mainline tubing. Overall, for a simple drip tape irrigation system in your vegetable garden having the proper filter regulator, tape/tubing, and fittings can make for a easy setup.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGw_ISj3xhI&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=22&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "Wheel Hoe Adjustments To Fit Your Needs!",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:13-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Wheel Hoe Adjustments on the Handles</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the different wheel hoe handles and styles. Depending on your desired height all of the <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/wheel-hoes/\">Wheel Hoes</a> contain a 15-inch steel wheel with Amish-crafted handles that are adjustable to any height. On every wheel hoe handle frame, there is an adjustable top bolt that is slotted to give you a range to move the handles to your desired height. To adjust the handle you simply take a 7/16\" wrench or socket and loosen the nut on the top bolt. This will allow you to move the handles in the groove to your preferred height. If your height is in the lower 5-foot range, you might want to consider our <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-junior/\">Junior Wheel Hoe</a> which is the same as other wheel hoes just shorter handles. With the Junior Wheel Hoe we simply just cut off 10-inches off the bottom of the handles. This allows you to adjust the handles just a lot lower than the standard wheel hoe handles. Where you have the handles positioned to your body is all personal preference. Travis likes to use his upper body to push the wheel hoe more so he has it adjusted to right about his belt line. If you prefer to use more of your lower body such as your legs to push the wheel hoe you may want to adjust it lower. The desired handle height will also depend on the certain attachment you are using on the Wheel Hoe. For example, when using the <a href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\">cultivator teeth attachment</a> to just scratch the surface the wheel hoe toolbar will be higher off the ground. While the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a> is used for digging deep in the soil the wheel hoe toolbar will be lower and almost level with the soil. Travis recommends not setting the handles while on a flat surface so go ahead and put the wheel hoe in the garden area so you can adjust the handles based on the levels of the attachments that you are planning on using. These wheel hoe adjustments are simple to make in order for you to effectively get the most out of your Wheel Hoe.\n<h2>Wheel Hoe Handle Styles</h2>\nAnother advantage of our wheel hoe adjustments we offer to fit your needs is two different styles of handles for the wheel hoe such as the steam bent handles or the pistol grip handles. With the <a href=\"/products/steam-bent-handles/\">steam beat handles</a> you wrap your hands around the handle. This style contains a curved end towards the end of the handle that allows you to easily grip and squeeze while going down the garden row. While the <a href=\"/products/pistol-grip-handles/\">pistol grip handles</a> fit more into the palm of your hand. They have a \"fat\" end to the handle that makes pushing the wheel hoe with the palm of your hands easier. The steam bent handles work better when using a traditional shuffling motion going down the row in the garden.  However, the pistol grip handles work better when using the plows only because you are just pushing in one direction. Both of these handles are Amish-crafted and made out of hardwood ash that will last forever.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGvq3cQg9jU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=23&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "Tips for Accurate Transplant Spacing in Your Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:13-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Transplant in the Garden?</h2>\nTransplants offer bountiful benefits when it comes to growing vegetables in the garden. Not only do you get to control when you plant seedlings but you also get healthier growing plants. If you have warmer weather vegetables that you would like to get a headstart on growing this allows you to prepare those vegetables before the growing season. So when the growing season begins and weather conditions are ideal you already have germinated plants that are ready to go in the soil in the vegetable garden. Transplanting also reduces weed pressures due to them having limited time in the garden. Weeds have a little amount of time to germinate in the garden around the transplants that we added into the garden. Another benefit is improved and faster crop turnaround. By starting the vegetables in transplants it can speed up the amount of time it takes them to germinate meaning less time in the garden area. With less time in the garden, more production is harvested and it allows for another crop to be planted in the same spot. Overall, transplanting allows for healthier and more productive vegetables while saving us time, money, and energy in the garden.\n<h2>Transplant Spacing</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis demonstrates the proper way to ensure transplant spacing. Travis has some Brussel sprout transplants that are ready to go in the ground. He has already laid his <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape</a> down in the garden. He prefers to turn the drip tape on and let the water pool up around the emitters this will help dictate the spacing for the transplants. However, after laying the drip tape then experienced a heavy amount of rainfall so he did not want to add more moisture to the soil from running the drip tape. Moving on to the next best option for transplant spacing is the <a href=\"/products/dibble-wheel-attachment/\">Double Dibble Wheel</a> attachment. This dibble wheel attachment works on the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single</a>, <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double</a>, and <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch</a> Wheel Hoe. This double dibble wheel has two wheels attached which is ideal for planting double rows on drip tape. Just simply straddle the drip tape with the two wheels and punch holes on both sides of the tape along the row in the garden. Travis set up his dibble wheels with every other dibble sticking out which is going to allow for about 10 to 12 inch spacing along the row. Before going along the row with the dibble wheel attachment, Travis mentions that he staggered the dibble wheels so that when going along the row there is never two plants right beside each other. This will ensure that the plants have plenty of room to grow and plenty of space in the vegetable garden. After the rain, he could slightly see a hump where the drip tape was laid so Travis just straddles the row with the double dibble wheel making the indentions in the soil for the transplant. This makes for one pass through and marks the planting locations equally along and between the row in the vegetable garden. Finally, all we have to do is insert those transplant plugs into the holes made by the dibble wheel. Then secure the transplants in the ground with a little bit of soil. So for accurate and precise transplant spacing consider looking into our dibble wheel hoe that is available as a single, double, or triple kit. With accurate transplant spacing, we will get higher yields, healthier plants, improved turnaround, and effective environmental impacts.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZbe-Qmujdo&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=24&amp;t=60s",

    "title": "Seed Starting Tray That Will Last a Lifetime!",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:12-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Seed Starting Tray vs. Soil Blocks</h2>\nMany gardeners know that the controversial topic of seed starting trays and soil blocks is all based on personal preference. The major difference in the two is all about time efficiency whether you are planting in a seed starting tray or you have all day to make soil blocks. It is no secret that making soil blocks are a time-consuming process that can take up half of your day trying to get the right consistency of potting soil and creating the blocks to plant in. While seed starting trays are quicker and easier to prepare for planting and provide great benefits for transplanting plants. The seed starting tray allows for control when planting in the greenhouse. Instead of waiting for temperatures to warm up you can get a jumpstart and prepare plants in the seed starting tray to have them ready to go in the ground when weather conditions are ideal. Overall, choose the best technique that you prefer but think about the most time consuming and money investment of both the seed starting trays and soil blocks.\n<h2>Our Seed Starting Tray vs. Store Bought Seed Trays</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about our popular seed starting tray that is used for vegetable transplants. Our heavy-duty <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> have 162 cells that make for productive and healthier transplants in the greenhouse. They are reusable and durable are guaranteed to outstand in other cheap flimsy seed starting tray from the big box stores. Due to the durability, they will take any kind of abuse and will truly last a lifetime. We like to use these trays for transplanting several different vegetables including broccoli, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, lettuce, kohlrabi, tomatoes, and peppers. To determine when the transplants are ready to go in the ground is really simple. Once the stem on that vegetable plant becomes strong enough and the roots are well developed you will be able to simply grab the stem of the plant and pull it right out of the seed starting tray. If they do not pull up out of the trays easily then you know they are not ready to go in the ground. Another tip is they pull up out of the cells a lot easier if the soil is dry this will make planting in the ground easier as well. Another advantage of our seed starting trays versus the cheaper store bought seed trays is the individual seed cells. Our seed trays have cells that are shaped like an upside down pyramid and they have a vertical root training rib. This root training rib allows the roots of the plant to grow downward ensuring better aeration and root ball drainage. Unlike the store bought seed trays that have square cells where the roots grow around the soil and become root bound. With the proper root training ribs from our seed starting tray, they allow for transplants to go in the ground with already established roots that are growing downwards in the soil. This will increase higher quality transplants that will produce quicker and suffer less transplant shock when moved from the tray to the ground. We recommend using our OMRI registered <a href=\"/products/pro-mix-organic-seed-starting-mix/\">Pro-Mix Organic Seed Starting Mix</a> with these seed starting trays. This seed starting mix works great for easy transplanting that offers better root ball formation and decreases transplant shock for more productive and healthier plants. Each bag of this mix contains 16 quarts, meaning one bag of the mix will sufficiently cover two of our 162-cell seed starting tray which is enough to grow 324 transplants in the greenhouse.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vak6TfLGicw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=25&amp;t=38s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Growing Vegetable Transplants</h2>\nWhy is growing vegetable transplants better than direct seeding? There are a number of reasons why vegetable transplants sometimes are better than direct seeding. These benefits include more control, increase production, reduce pest problems, and improve healthier plants. Transplants give you a jumpstart on the growing season because you can start transplanting seeds and once the weather conditions are just right, moving them into the garden will allow for more production. Due to the transplants beginning in the greenhouse they are kept safe from most insects that like to destroy tiny seedlings when first planted. Overall, transplants make healthier plants because they provide better growing strategies that allow them to be more productive and decrease problems at the early stages of plant life. However, some vegetables only do well when direct seeded such as carrots, melons, radishes, turnips, etc. These vegetables contain delicate root systems that like to grow in one place and not be moved around. When direct seeding using our <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/walk-behind-garden-seeder-planter/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> which allows for accurate planting without overplanting in the garden area. This garden seeder offers six adjustable seed plates that work great for several different varieties of crops. Whether you prefer direct seeding or starting vegetable transplants both are easy tasks to do in the greenhouse or vegetable garden when using efficient tools.\n<h2>Step by Step Guide on Starting Vegetable Transplants</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis demonstrates the step by step method for starting vegetable transplants in the greenhouse. To begin vegetable transplants in the greenhouse the first thing we need is a seed starting tray and a seed starting mix. Our heavy-duty <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> have 162 cells that contain verticle root training ribs that allow for better aeration and root ball drainage. The seed starting mix we always like to use when transplanting is the organic <a href=\"/products/pro-mix-organic-seed-starting-mix/\">Pro-Mix</a>. Unlike other potting mixes, the Pro-Mix has a fine texture that ensures better root development which reduces transplant shock and bacterial/fungal diseases. It also contains a component known as MycoActive which promotes a symbiotic relationship between beneficial fungi and plant roots. To begin he starts by filling the entire seed starting tray with the Pro-Mix seed starting mix. Once the seed mix is smoothed out and compacted into the tray we will add some water to get it wet before planting. Travis likes to take his watering wand and wet it once, wait a minute or two and wet it again. Wetting it two or three will ensure the soil is nicely wet and saturated. The next step is to create dibbles or small holes in the soil for the seeds. Keep in mind when planting seeds they typically are planted twice as deep as the diameter of the seed. Travis takes some of his broccoli seed and plants one seed per cell in the seed starting tray. Then, he recommends taking a cup filled with the Pro-Mix, but while adding it to the cup he grinds it up making sure to remove any kind of big clumps. Next, he takes the cup and lightly covers or dust the tops of the seed with the fine soil. After the seeds are lightly covered then he waters the entire tray again making sure the soil is compacted. Lastly, add a <a href=\"/products/wood-garden-labels/\">garden label</a> to help you identify what variety of plant was planted in the seed starting tray. Wait a couple of weeks and you will have some productive transplants that are ready to go in the ground when weather conditions are suitable. Using these efficient tools to make vegetable transplants will ensure productive and healthy plants for the garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxITSiL7Fg4&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=26&amp;t=69s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:10-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What are Root-Knot Nematodes?</h2>\nRoot-knot nematodes are microscopic parasitic roundworms that like to feed on the roots of the vegetable plants. Some crops such as okra, squash, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, or eggplants tend to be highly-susceptible to root-knot nematode problems more than other any other crops in the garden. They are commonly found in sandy-well drained soils allowing them with more mobility to move around easily in the soil. The nematodes get their root-knot name due to the way they feed on the roots it causes swelling or knots on the plant roots. There are several different types of nematodes but there are only two forms that they are identified under -- predatory and parasitic. The predatory nematodes are beneficial because they help with attacking garden pest like squash vine borers and cutworms. While parasitic nematodes are dangerous to the vegetable garden. Parasitic nematodes will cause plants to become weak and stunt growth. When managing parasitic nematodes many factors like good crop rotation, planting cover crops, adding organic matter, and clearing out and removing all the roots of old plants will help reduce these nematode pressures in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Managing Parasitic Nematodes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis discusses ways for managing parasitic nematodes in the vegetable garden. Biofumigation is a sustainable practice that we use to eliminate soil-borne pests and diseases that damage many of our vegetable crops in the garden. Crops like mustard when broken down into the soil they will release certain chemical compounds that help with the eliminate and reduce the presence of these harmful soil pests. When Travis was clearing out some of his okra plants he noticed some root-knot nematode problems. According to Travis, managing parasitic nematode problems begin by marking off around a 10-foot wide path were his previous okra plants were planted in the garden area. Then, plant in that area a dense patch of <a href=\"/products/broadleaf-mustard/\">Broadleaf Mustard</a>. This cover crop can release chemicals that will reduce nematode, insects, fungi, and weeds in the garden soil. Mustard is one of the best cover crops for suppressing these nematode populations. Not only will it help with the reduction of nematodes, but it will also add biomass that will increase organic matter in the soil. Increasing the organic matter in the soil will help improve soil tilth and better erosion control. In return, this will ensure better water runoff and decrease nutrient leaching in the vegetable garden. Using his <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> with the adjustable seed plates he takes the #1 seed plate and drills out a hole to add eight more holes to get a total of 16 holes in the seed plate. This seed plate will allow for close to around one inch of row spacing when planting. Next, Travis will take his garden seeder and plant the mustard in rows around three to four inches apart in the garden. He prefers to plant the rows tight to allow for as much vegetation as he can get in the little 10-foot wide path. For all cover crops, in order for them to make an impact in the soil, it should be chopped and tilled back into the soil. So once the broadleaf mustard reaches a decent size and before it goes to seed till it into the soil. Incorporating it into the soil will allow for those chemicals to effectively kill off the harmful pests and disease problems in the vegetable garden. So if you catch any root-knot nematode problems in the root of plants begin adding cover crops that will help destroy these in the soil and begin managing parasitic nematodes in the vegetable garden.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7HrDB6xZIc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=27&amp;t=32s",

    "title": "Best Salad Mix Recipe from Vegetables in the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:10-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Green Vegetables in the Garden</h2>\nThere are several different green varieties that can be grown in the vegetable garden. Leafy green vegetable varieties like lettuce, kale, beans, collards, or peas all add a variation to the garden area. When growing greens they should be planted during early spring or late summer. Not only are they easy to grow, but they add several nutrition benefits and healthier plants for the best salad mix. However, many greens are susceptible to pests, disease, and weed pressures. As well as, insufficient watering can slow down or halt the plant growth in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Premium Green Mix</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis has the best salad mix recipe using vegetables from the garden. In the early Spring and Fall, the <a href=\"/products/premium-greens-mix/\">Asian salad green mix</a> is one of Travis's favorite crops to grow. With a combination of greens like Tatsoi, Mizuna, Red Russian Kale, and Arugula this mix is great for salads or sauteing up to stir-fry. Each of these types of greens has a couple of differences that set them apart. <a href=\"/products/tatsoi-greens/\">Tatsoi</a> has a dark green leaf with a mild mustard flavor profile. The elongated feathered leaves of <a href=\"/products/mizuna-greens/\">Mizuna</a> is known to hold seasoning and sauces well when used in salads. Red Russian Kale has a clean kale flavor that balances out some of the other green flavors in the mix. As <a href=\"/products/arugula/\">Arugula</a> leaves get larger the flavors become more vibrant in the mix. The preferred method for planting is direct seeding really dense or really thick on a bed. Travis prefers to plant the green mix on either a 24 inch or a 2-foot bed. This size bed is easier to straddle and makes it more comfortable when it comes time to harvest the Asian green mix. For direct seeding, our <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/walk-behind-garden-seeder-planter/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> works perfectly to easily and quickly plant seeds in the vegetable garden. Travis takes a customized seed plate that has 1-inch spacing then ties up the kickstand on the garden seeder. He likes to plant wheel-to-wheel meaning planting as many rows as he can squeeze in the 2-foot wide band. Due to the greens being planted so thick they do better with overhead or hand watering rather than drip irrigation. Asian greens are better off planted on the edge of the garden because it makes it easier to water every other day with a hand watering wand or overhead system. When it comes to harvesting these green mixes we just straddle the bed and cut off the tops of the greens when they reach between 6 to 8 inches tall. When harvesting we like to use our <a href=\"/products/large-shallow-tubtrug/\">Large Shallow Tubtrug</a> for easy sorting and lightweight carrying for all ages. These greens will have continuous growth, so you can get at least four cuttings off them during the spring and fall months. In the fall, sometimes you can harvest even more because the temperatures are usually decreasing and you do not have to worry about the greens bolting in the garden. When it comes to storing these green mixes we prefer to take a few handfuls and put them in produce bags kinda like the ones at the grocery store. Then once they are in the produce bags he takes his knife and punches a few holes to get some aeration. They typically store for at least a week in the refrigerator. For longer storage and to avoid diseases we should not wash these until we are ready to eat or cook them. If you want to have the best salad mix around try growing some of these Asian green mixes in your vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRucpAIecYc&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=28&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:10-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What are Corn Earworms?</h2>\nKnown as the greatest threat for sweet corn production, earworms are an insect that can be hard to control and kill in the garden area. Corn earworms have various different color combinations including green or brown. The problem with not effectively removing earworms is they can overwinter in the soil which will allow them to come back and cause even more issues in the garden. Like several other insects killing them in the nymph or early stages will stop them from becoming impossible to kill in the adult stages. Most of the earworm damage is done at the ear tips leaving the corn deformed and susceptible to mold and diseases. To ensure you are preventing earworms in corn the best method is to have a preventative program in place for the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Preventing Earworms in Corn</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis identifies ways of preventing earworms from becoming a major problem in the vegetable garden. Travis has planted his sweet corn for the fall growing season. He decided to plant a couple of rows of the hybrid ambrosia variety. The <a href=\"/products/ambrosia-sweet-corn/\">Ambrosia Sweet Corn</a> is a white and yellow bicolor that has a sugary-enhanced flavor profile. After harvesting, it can be stored for up to 10 days and a little longer when creamed and frozen. When deciding how to plant corn in the garden area it should be planted in square plots instead of long rows for germination and pollination purposes. The recommended way to plant sweet corn in the garden is with our walk behind <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/walk-behind-garden-seeder-planter/\">garden seeder</a>. The durable garden seeder has seed plates that are also adjustable for other seeds when planting. On corn, the silks and tassels are simply the male and female part of the corn that ensures pollination. The tassels job is to produce pollen which encourages growth and riping of the corn ear. While the silks job is to take up the pollen that the tassel makes and create corn kernels. Once the corn has reached the silks and tassel stage with pollination that is when we start to see earworms beginning to damage the tops of our corn ears. The larval form of a moth likes to lay eggs on the corn plants. These moths are attracted to the smell of the corn silks and that is typically where they will lay their eggs. The best organic control for earworms is our <a href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\">Spinosad Garden Insect Spray</a>. Similar to <a href=\"/products/monterey-b-t/\">Monterey B.t.</a>, Spinosad is derived from a naturally occurring bacteria. For B.t. to work, the insects should ingest the insecticide. However, spinosad works on contact and ingestion by the insects. The mixing ratio is two ounces of spinosad and one gallon of water. The recommended application rate for spinosad on corn is one gallon per 150 to 200-row feet of corn. Another benefit of using Spinosad is insects and pest cannot build a resistance to it, unlike other organic controls. To get really good coverage it's important to spray this Spinosad on the tops of the silks and tassels of the corn where the earworms are known to be hiding out. Travis likes to begin spraying spinosad once the silks start to become visible on the corn. He will start a program and spray this insecticide at least 4 to 5 days until the corn is ready to harvest in the garden. It also works great on controlling other worms like caterpillars, thrips, fire ants, and other insects. Overall, when preventing earworms it is important to apply organically controlled insecticides in the garden before it causes major damage in your sweet corn.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQaFftODaaU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=29&amp;t=50s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Best Ways to Control Critters in the Garden</h2>\nWhen producing vegetables in the garden you are prone to have many issues with critters eating away at your freshly growing plants. There a couple of methods to help control these rabbits, squirrels, or deer from destroying your garden. Once you identify which critter is nibbling in the garden you can apply the correct pesticide to spray. Typically the pesticides do not taste good to the critters so they will avoid eating the plants altogether. We recommend using pesticides that are all-natural or organic because they provide healthier plants and keep your garden clear of any harsh chemicals. Another way to avoid rabbits damaging the plants is to add some <a href=\"/products/48-raised-bed-kit/\">raised beds</a> in the garden area. We suggest using our handheld <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-sprayer/\">garden sprayer</a> to apply any pesticide or fungicide applications in the vegetable garden. For other insect problems like worms, thrips, ants, or whiteflies use our insecticides like <a href=\"/products/take-down-garden-spray/\">Take Down Garden Spray</a>, <a href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\">Spinosad</a>, <a href=\"/products/bug-buster/\">Bug Buster</a>, or <a href=\"/products/monterey-b-t/\">Monterey B.t</a>.\n<h2>Avoid Rabbits &amp; Other Critters</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the best ways to remove rabbits and other critters from damaging plants in the vegetable garden. Travis just planted a variety of <a href=\"/products/tiger-collard/\">Tiger collards</a> in the garden. This productive hybrid variety is very bolt-resistant in the heat and can persist well in the extremely harsh cold climates. During the fall months, he typically experiences some pressure from rabbits and other small critters that like to nibble in the garden and eat the transplants down to the stem. In order to be proactive and stay on top of these critters from eating the plants, Travis recommends spraying pesticides early. A natural garden spray like <a href=\"/products/rabbit-and-squirrel-repellent/\">Bobbex</a> will work effectively control rabbits, squirrels, groundhogs, and other critters in the garden. This is a foliar spray product that is known to do much better than ground sprays. This should be sprayed directly on the plant, but do not spray on any plant that is about ready to be harvested. The foliar spray needs to be used early on in the growth of the plant to condition the animals from eating the leaves because it does not taste good to them. Another benefit of the Bobbex is it has a sticking agent which means it will not wash off when it rains so you don't have to worry about re-applying it after a rainfall. Travis recommends spraying it early in the life of the plants about once every week or two to avoid any damage from happening. During the spring and summer, apply this Bobbex application every 10 to 14 days on plants that unprotected new growth and quickly growing plants in the vegetable garden. During the fall and winter, apply applications every 4 to 8 weeks depending on how bad the pest issue is in the garden. We also offer this Bobbex product in a <a href=\"/products/deer-repellent/\">Deer Repellent</a> foliar spray. These Bobbex sprays come in 32 and 64-ounce jugs. Whether you are trying to avoid rabbits, groundhogs, squirrels or other small critters using a foliar spray like the Bobbex, Rabbit and Squirrel Repellent should do the trick if applied frequently and early on in plant life.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwpBtElPbIg&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=30&amp;t=12s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:09-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Okra Plants in the Garden</h2>\nTraditionally grown in the South, okra thrives well due to its love for warmer weather. So planting okra in the summer growing seasons is perfect because many other vegetable crops cannot grow due to the harsh climate conditions. Okra plants tend to grow tall and need plenty of spacing to grow. With only 50 days to maturity, okra works great for succession planting too. These plants benefit from soils that range between pH levels of 6.5 to 7.0. Before planting in the soil, okra benefits from having plenty of good compost or rich organic matter. We suggest applying a little bit of <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20 garden fertilizer</a> to help the plants germinate. With equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium the 20-20-20 is a water-soluble formula that is ideal for dissolving and injecting into the <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo fertilizer injector</a> or a drip irrigation system. To get a head start on the growing season transplanting okra in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a> allows them to germinate and be ready to go in the ground as soon as the weather conditions are just right. If you prefer to direct seed the okra plants wait till around late spring and summer months. You can use our walk behind <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/walk-behind-garden-seeder-planter/\">garden seeder</a> to direct seed the plants. This versatile planter tool has multiple adjustable seed plates that allow for a variety of seeds to be planted in the garden seeder. Overall, we suggest growing okra during the spring, summer, and fall months.\n<h2>Pruning or \"Whooping\"</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis describes the difference between pruning or whooping okra plants. Pruning is done to cut away in dead or overgrown stems to increase production and better growth in plants. To whoop your okra means to go along the okra plants with a switch or limb and beat the sides of the okra. The theory behind it is it will stress the plant and make it produce more in the garden. Travis has planted three rows of the <a href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\">Jambalaya Okra</a> variety in his garden. Jambalaya okra is a very productive, hybrid variety producing many green pods for pickling, stewing, or frying. These pods are best picked when four to six inches long. Travis did an experiment on the okra plants he planted in his garden once they reached around three foot tall. He pruned one row, left one alone, and whooped the last row. What he found, as a result, was that the row that he whooped and pruned did a little better than the row that he left alone in the garden. Also, the okra row that he pruned made it way easier to harvest. Travis does not like to use shears or any cutting tool when pruning. He likes to prune the okra by just grabbing the lateral limbs of the plant and snapping them to pull off the base of the plant. If you pull some of the skin off the base of the plant it will not hurt the plant it will end up healing over and it will be just fine. Travis is not fully convinced that pruning or whooping the plants ends up making more production. If you do not prune the plants some of the lateral stems will end up producing okra. However, pruning or whooping does make it way easier to harvest and manageable in the garden. Travis recommends trying the pruning or whooping method out in the garden to see the wonderful results for yourself that maximize production of okra plants. Either way pruning or whooping will leave your garden easier to manage, harvest, and improve production.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_9NkCpLl6Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=31&amp;t=36s",

The easiest way to maximize garden production with effective irrigation and steady water-soluble fertilizers is through the use of <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">drip tape</a>. Most people believe that drip tape can be used either on top or buried in the soil. However, drip tape was really made to go underneath the soil in the garden. This allows the tape to stay in place, decrease disease pressure and damage by natural causes, and provides accurate nutrients for plant growth. Not only does it apply equal amounts of irrigation to the plant, but it conserves water by going directly to the plant roots in the vegetable garden, unlike overhead irrigation systems.\n<h2>The Easiest Way to Bury Drip Tape</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis demonstrates the best methods for burying drip tape. Drip tape can be buried up to six inches deep in the soil. He usually only buries his tape around three to four inches deep in the ground. If you do not have our <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single</a>, <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double</a> or <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch</a> Wheel Hoe the best way to do this is to use a long handle garden hoe. Taking the garden hoe you will make a little trench where you would like your row to go. Once you have dug out the trench lay the drip tape down in it with the emitters facing upwards and then cover it up with the garden hoe. Another option would be to take our Double Wheel Hoe with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">Plow Set</a> and make a furrow to lay the drip tape by hand in the row then turn those plows around to cover the row back up. The last and easiest option is to use our Double Wheel Hoe with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer attachment</a>. Usually laying drip tape is a two-person job, with this tape layer attachment it makes it a simple one-person job. It lays the tape and covers it simultaneously in one pass through. When installing the drip tape layer it contains four simple pieces that come with it. The first piece is the roller guide assembly which is used to place the tape into the little roller which guides it through the sleeve and directs it towards the ground. Once the tape goes through the roller guide assembly it will roll along to the roll layer. The roll layer has a grooved out piece that guides and holds the drip tape. Next, you have a bracket that sits on top of the wheel hoe toolbar which holds the roll of drip tape in place. The last piece that goes with the drip tape layer attachment is the spool axle. The spool axle is what the drip tape layer sits on and contains two knobs on each side that allows you to adjust the tension to whatever you prefer. The last attachment to add is the plow set to the back of the double wheel hoe. The plow sets will cover up the drip tape when you go along the row and lay it. While the drip tape layer attachment can be really easy to install if you do a lot of drip tape laying, Travis suggests having a dedicated double wheel hoe just for drip tape. Having this dedicated drip tape layer wheel hoe will save you a lot of time and make things easier in the vegetable garden. The easiest way to bury drip is by following these simple methods or using our drip tape layer attachment.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2bC2L7HBik\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=32&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:08-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Drip Tape</h2>\nThere are countless benefits when it comes to why drip tape is important in the garden area. Not only is it better for the vegetable plants in the garden, but it will conserve water, reduce disease and pest pressures, and improve plant growth. Other alternatives like overhead irrigation or soaker hoses will leave you with unnecessary watering, fewer benefits, as well as wasted time and money. The drip tape is intended to be buried underneath the soil in order to maintain maximum results and improve better gardening techniques. With our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip tape irrigation kit</a>, it contains everything you will need to start a drip system in your garden area.\n<h2>Top 6 Reasons for Burying Drip Tape</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the top six best reasons behind burying drip tape in the vegetable garden. The first reason behind burying your drip tape is for improved water conservation. Previous studies say that when burying drip tape you will use 40% less water than leaving the drip tape on top of the soil. When left on top of the soil drip tape is gonna be losing a significant amount of water due to evaporation. If they are buried you're gonna get a much more effective flow of water to the plant. The second reason is the drip tape will stay in place underneath the soil where it needs to be for the plants. With the drip tape on top of the soil, it has a tendency to move around by wind and other natural elements within the garden. Another benefit of burying drip tape underneath the soil it allows you to direct seed on top of the tape with our <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/seeders/home/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. Thirdly, avoid rodent damage in your drip tape when buried underneath the soil. If the tape is left on top of the soil, rodents become a problem by chewing into the tape. While underneath the soil it can become less of an issue because it is not as accessible. The fourth reason to bury the drip tape under the soil is to help eliminate soil crusting. When you get a heavy rain typically the soil will crust over the top of the soil which makes it hard to cultivate the same goes for leaving drip tape on top of the soil. By burying the drip tape this will eliminate that soil crusting on our soil and it will remain easier to cultivate. The fifth reason allows effective delivery of fertilizer to the plants. With a drip irrigation system, this allows us to not only water our plants effectively but fertilize them too with a water-soluble fertilizer. With it buried beneath the soil, the plants are getting delivered direct fertilizer to the plant roots. This is not the case with drip tape laying along the top of the soil. Finally, the last benefit of burying the drip tape under the soil is easier cultivation in the vegetable garden. If drip tape is left along the top of the soil you will have to move that tape out of the way every time to cultivate the weeds and other areas in the garden. When burying tape under the soil we can use our <a href=\"/products/single-tine-cultivator/\">single tine cultivator</a> and just skim the surface of the soil to remove any weeds that have appeared in the garden. If you want a better overall production of plants in the vegetable garden, consider burying the drip tape and follow these top six reasons because it will give you many more advantages that will last a lot longer than other alternatives.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsXbXhEi67M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=33&amp;t=57s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:08-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Easiest Way to Water the Garden</h2>\nThe best method to effectively provide enough water to the garden is using a drip tape irrigation system. Drip tape systems allow you to conserve water and supply the plant with all the water it needs for all growing stages. Another benefit is drip tape irrigations reduces disease and weed pressures in the vegetable garden. With overhead watering, you tend to water the edges of the garden and in between rows that are not planted with anything which will increase weed germination in those areas. Drip tape irrigation reduces those issues because the water is going directly to the plant roots and it will conserve more water in the vegetable garden. Another advantage caused by drip tape being buried in the soil is it allows for the plant to not contain constant moisture on the leaves which will reduce foliage diseases causing issues in the garden area. Overall, the difference between drip tape and soaker hoses can be based on your personal preference for the garden area.\n<h2>Drip Tape vs. Soaker Hose</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the difference between drip tape and soaker hose in the vegetable garden. <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">Drip tape</a> is made out of a collapsible polyethylene tubing that lays flat when not in use and when you supply water it can become pressurized which swells up. The drip tape has emitters that are equally spaced 12 inches along the drip tape. These emitters are where the water flows out and they come already punched equally into the drip tape. Most drip tapes will have a water output of 0.4 gallons per minute per 100 feet of tape. For example, if you have a thousand feet of tape in your vegetable garden you will be supplying 4 gallons of water per minute along that entire system. The mainline tubing for drip tape is going to feed the individual lines running through the garden. At the beginning of each row of tape, you will have a <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-start-valve/\">row start valve</a> that will connect the drip tape and the actual mainline tubing. The row starter valves also allow you to control the flow on individual drip irrigation tape lines in the rows. Then at the end of each row, you will have a <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-end/\">drip tape row end</a> that will seal off the tape at the end of the row. This will create the equalized pressure along the entire length of drip tape in the garden. If you have our <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">Plow Set</a> we have a <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer attachment</a> that works perfectly for laying drip tape in rows in the garden area. We recommend using the plow set with it in order to bury the drip tape in one single passing. Drip tape provides a frequent slow watering that will increase harvest production and a better vegetable garden area.\n\nHowever, a soaker hose has a couple of difference between drip tape systems. Drip tape is consistent in water output and soaker hoses are inconsistent when it comes to water output. A soaker hose does not have several adjustable fittings or the radius of coverage that drip tape offers. The soaker hose is usually made out of recycled rubber and they tend to get brittle from the sun which makes them not last as long as drip tape. They will also tear/break fairly easy and can be lot more pricer than drip tape. When looking over the difference between drip tape and a soaker hose choose the best method that will last for a long time, conserve water, reduce problems, and save you time and money in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkmGORIR9p4&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=34&amp;t=35s",

    "title": "Pole Beans on a Paneled Trellis in the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:08-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Uses of a Paneled Trellis in the Garden</h2>\nThe purpose of using a paneled trellis in the garden is to help ensure climbing plants are getting support. The trellis method helps crops like tomatoes, beans, peas, or squash grow vertically and keep them off the ground in the garden. Removing them from the ground will help reduce critters and soil-borne diseases from taking over the crop in the garden. Another advantage of using the trellising method is saving space in the garden. If you have a limited garden size, having a trellis system for crops will help them grow vertically and save space alongside several rows.\n<h2>Paneled Trellis Method</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains how to properly use pole beans on a paneled trellis in the vegetable garden. Most crops like pole beans, cucumbers, or running butter beans using a garden trellis is a great method. Travis likes to use 16 foot long galvanized cattle panel and support them with a T-post along the row. Typically just two or three T-posts per 16 foot long panels works perfectly. Most of these panels are pretty easy to set up and install, but getting the maximum utility is also important in the garden. Travis installed the panels for growing cucumbers this spring and now he wants to plant pole beans on a paneled trellis. Avoid planting the same crop on the same panel for two consecutive seasons or years. The best option is to rotate these crops to avoid pest and disease pressures. Travis usually plants two crops on this panel one in the spring and one in the fall. Then move the panel to another spot to keep the rotation going in the vegetable garden. For the fall season, he decided to plant <a href=\"/products/rattlesnake-pole-bean/\">Rattlesnake Pole Beans</a> and <a href=\"/products/christmas-lima-pole-bean/\">Christmas Lima Beans</a>. Travis splits the trellis in half when planting the rattlesnake pole beans and the Christmas Lima beans. The rattlesnake pole beans are an heirloom variety with a wonderful flavor profile. This variety can be harvested frequently and produce six to seven-inch pods. The Christmas Lima beans are another productive heirloom variety with another great flavor profile. When planting the beans he likes to take his <a href=\"/products/section-garden-hoe/\">section hoe</a> and dig out a little trench alongside the cattle panel. This allows him to go in and lay his <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">drip tape</a> underneath and eventually plant there too. You should not try and use the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">drip tape layer attachment</a> right up against the panel because there is not enough space. So what Travis likes to do is set the drip tape layer at the end of the row and use it as a spool while pulling the tape he needs and walks alongside the trench. He will lay it in the trench with the emitters facing upward. Then, he will lay a light layer of compost along the row to cover the drip tape. The next step is planting those pole beans on the paneled trellis. Travis suggests planting the seeds pretty thick in the furrow alongside the panel. Once the seeds are planted in the furrow he takes his <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">dura rake</a> and pushes some soil on top of the seeds. Then, turn the dura rake over and tamp it down along the row. We have used this method in the past when planting cucumbers in the spring then English peas on the trellis in the fall. Using the trellis year-round in the growing season by rotating the crops will ensure the cattle panel has been used for maximum utility and you have plenty production of vegetables for both the fall and spring seasons.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/39E_wdruksQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=35&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:07-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Fertilizing</h2>\nTo ensure that crops are getting accurate supplements of nutrients that are required for plant growth, fertilizing plays a key role. Most fertilizers contain three major macronutrients: nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Without these nutrients, the plant cannot obtain its needs and the plant growth will contain a nutrient deficiency which will stop plant growth overall. The best way to fertilize is with systems such as <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a>, <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo Fertilizer Injector</a>, or the Brass Siphon Mixer. Based on the certain type of crop, applying the accurate amount and frequency of fertilizer is important to ensure that the plants are getting all the nutrients they need and are not overly fertilized in the vegetable garden. Be careful to not add too much fertilizer in the garden because it can cause negative effects such as root burn, pest/disease pressures, decrease plant health, and some environmental issues. However, the use of fertilizers helps supply benefits that every plant needs to grow in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Fertilizing Vegetable Seedlings</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis demonstrates the best way to fertilize vegetable seedlings in the greenhouse. Once the vegetable seeds germinate and start to emerge from the soil then we should start to add some fertilizer. When the plants get there first set of true leaves which is actually the second set of true leaves that's when adding fertilizer really starts to begin. The best way to fertilize is by using our favorite simple little tool known as the <a href=\"/products/brass-siphon-mixer/\">Brass Siphon Mixer</a>. This fertilizer tool is used to accurately proportion any fertilizer, pesticide, or fungicide into a small watering system where you plan to do mostly hand watering to the plant transplants. To install the brass siphon mixer you hook it up to your faucet and then hook the water hose up beneath it. This brass siphon mixer has a built-in backflow preventer which will not allow any fertilizer to travel back into the water supply system. This black tube that is attached is simply placed into a bucket with your dissolved fertilizer and it is going to pull that up and inject it into the water hose and your attached nozzle for watering the plants. Any type of water-soluble fertilizer will work with this tool but for vegetable seedlings, we recommend using <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a>. This 20-20-20 contains a balanced ratio of (20%) potassium, (20%) phosphorous, and (20%) nitrogen which are all major macronutrients that plants need for all stages of growth. Travis likes to take anywhere from one to two cups of the 20-20-20 and dissolve it into a five-gallon bucket. He suggests for dissolving it works better in warm water, but in cold water with a little more stirring, it does fine too. Then just add the black tube that is attached to the brass siphon mixer into the dissolved fertilizer solution. This will begin to pull up the fertilizer and inject it into our water supply at 16:1. The 16:1 ratio means for every 16 gallons of water we put out we are putting out one gallon of that fertilizer solution. When discussing the frequency of injecting this fertilizer Travis recommends fertilizing the vegetable transplants or seedlings at least twice a week in the greenhouse. If you are not fertilizing the transplants and you are just planning on watering the plants then we will move that tube to just a clean bucket of water. Applying an accurate amount of fertilizer to these vegetable seedlings or transplants is important to ensure the healthiness of the plant growth and roots for the transition period from the greenhouse to the vegetable garden area.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/96cvTCxlXPw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=36&amp;t=62s",

    "title": "Growing Vegetable Transplants with the Best Seed Starting Mix",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:07-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing Vegetable Transplants</h2>\nWhen choosing to grow your own vegetable transplants there are many benefits that can improve your vegetable garden. The first benefit is it can be cheaper to buy than paying around three to five dollars a plant from big-box stores. Another benefit is choosing your own varieties that you would like to personally plant instead of just planting what the store has offered. Thirdly it allows you to get a jump start on the growing season. When transplanting vegetables in the greenhouse you are ahead of the growing season which allows for the plants to be ready to go in the garden as soon as the weather conditions are suitable. For example, if you plan on growing warm weather crops like watermelons or okra. Instead of waiting for soil temps to warm up for seed planting, you can go ahead and plant these crops into our seed starting tray which allows them to be ready to go in the garden when the weather conditions are just right. Lastly, the best benefit of them all is growing healthier plants in the greenhouse and vegetable garden.\n<h2>Best Seed Starting Mix</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the importance of growing your own vegetable transplants with the best seed starting mix. The most important step in growing vegetable transplants is finding the proper seed starting mix to accommodate those transplants. There is a difference between seed starting mix and potting mix when it comes to planting transplants. The potting mix tends to be more chunky and contain pieces of sticks/barks in them. Also not as light or airy like seed starting mix. For seed starting mix we are looking for fine not chunky that allows the roots to wrap around the soil. When the roots wrap around the soil this helps establish a great root ball for when we go to transplant the plants in the ground. The best seed starting mix that Travis recommends is the <a href=\"/products/pro-mix-organic-seed-starting-mix/\">Pro-Mix Seed Starting Mix</a>. He has trialed this mix versus other mixes for several years and this Pro-Mix has always performed the best for growing vegetable transplants. This Pro-Mix is OMRI listed for organic vegetable production. It contains a lightweight mixture that has a nice consistency and contains plenty of perlites. These white stones of perlite are important when growing your own vegetable transplants because they will help improve airflow and drainage of the plant roots. Another advantage of this Pro-Mix is it includes MycoActive which promotes mycorrhizal associations. Mycorrhizal associations are a symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants which provide benefits to the growing plants. The fungi provide absorption ability for the plant roots, while the plant roots provide food or glucose to the fungi. This Pro-Mix bag contains 16 quarts which are sufficient for two <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. Our seed starting trays each have 162 cells with internal vertical root training ribs that help with root ball drainage and aeration as well. A nice root ball drainage will help reduce transplant shock and bacterial/fungal diseases which allows improved healthier and productive plants. This seed starting Pro-Mix works great for any of the nightshade family crops like tomatoes, eggplants, or peppers. Also, works great for growing vegetable transplants like broccoli, cabbage, kohlrabi, or kale. Some flower transplants to such as sunflowers, zinnias, or celosia. When looking to grow your own transplants choose the right seed starting mix like Pro-Mix instead of using regular potting mixes from the store. This seed starting mix will ensure healthier vegetable transplants and improve better performance when moving them from the greenhouse to the outside garden area.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKgpT6cW3zc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=37&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "Properly Remove and Reuse Drip Tape",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:06-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Drip Tape in the Garden</h2>\nWhen choosing between overhead and drip tape irrigation, drip tape outweighs the overhead with many benefits. Drip tape is perfect for efficiently conserving water, reduce disease pressures, and leads to better plant health. This drip irrigation system conserves water because the water pressure is going directly to the plant roots instead of over the whole garden area. Due to the plant roots getting the most water this will provide ideal plant growth conditions. Another benefit is the decrease in weed pressures in the garden. With overhead irrigation, many areas are unnecessarily watered which causes weed germination where it is not needed in the garden. Drip tape also reduces fungal diseases due to fewer moisture conditions being applied to the foliage. All of these advantages allow drip irrigation to be the best system when growing vegetable crops in the garden.\n<h2>Removing and Reusing Drip Tape</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains how to properly remove and reuse drip tape. When removing drip tape from the garden it can be rather simple. The best way to remove tape is to pull the end of the row or the beginning of the row and walk along the row pulling the tape out of the soil. However, there is one step that needs to be done before removing the drip tape off of some of the larger rooted crops like sweet corn. After harvesting sweet corn you should cut the stalks down with a machete while they are still green. If the stalks are still green they will dry up faster and then a few weeks later you can pull the drip tape up from the ground. Then clean that area in the garden and prepare it for the next crop you plan to plant in that spot. Once you properly remove all the tape from the garden area there are a couple of options that you can do with it. He recommends leaving the drip tape connected to the mainline and pull it over the mainline on the other side of the garden. This will cultivate the area and put the drip tape right back down for planting something else in that area. This allows you from not having to disconnect the mainline from the drip tape. However, if you do not plan on planting anything in that area for a while you should disconnect everything and use a <a href=\"/products/goof-plugs/\">goof plug</a> to plug the hole in the mainline. If you are using the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-start-valve/\">drip tape row start valves</a> you can just take the tape off leaving the row start connected and turn the valve off. The row start valve will serve like the goof plugs and stop water from coming out of the mainline. When using the <a href=\"/products/drip-irrigation-tape/\">8 mil drip tape</a>, Travis can usually plant four crops off that before replacing it. If you are not growing year-round in the garden you can reuse the tape in the next growing season. Just make sure to wash out all the fittings and properly remove the soil and grit from the surrounding nut and barb so they will work well next time you use them. If you have a <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">Plow Set</a> attachment you can use the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer Attachment</a> to make laying drip tape a one person job that is an easy and fast process. Overall, if you are looking to properly remove and reuse drip tape in the garden area it has a lot of effective advantages that will save you time and money that is unlike overhead irrigation systems.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYUc5K4A7-8&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=38&amp;t=50s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Squash Bugs in the Garden</h2>\nIn the South, the most common and destructive insects in the garden are <em>anasa tristis</em> also known as squash bugs. These leaf-footed squash bugs have a life expectancy of 75 to 130 days. Within that life period, they can lay anywhere from two to three batches of eggs with 18 to 20 eggs per batch. Once laid it can take between six to eight weeks for that egg to become a mature adult and start causing serious problems in the vegetable garden. These squash bugs can feed on your cucurbits such as squash, cucumbers, and melons. The affect the fruits by injecting toxic saliva into the crops and which causes them to become debilitating. Controlling the squash bugs early on will help decrease the population from becoming impossible to kill in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Controlling Squash Bugs</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains how to organically control the destructive squash bugs that are causing issues in the vegetable garden. When organically controlling squash bugs we like to use the IPM strategy which stands for Integrated Pest Management. This strategy involves both chemical and mechanical controls to decrease those squash bug pressures in the garden. For the chemical controls, we will start early in the plant life by using Neem Oil and pyrethrin like Take Down Garden Spray. An OMRI registered product, <a href=\"/products/neem-oil/\">Neem Oil</a> works great to control insects like aphids, beetles, whiteflies, and squash bugs. It also can be used to control fungal diseases like powdery mildew, black spot, and blight. Another organic product is <a href=\"/products/take-down-garden-spray/\">Take Down Garden Spray</a> contains natural pyrethrin and canola oil. This combination allows for quick knockdown and residual control. It can also help control aphids, caterpillars, whiteflies, ants, and other insects. When using Neem Oil and Take Down Garden Spray these organic products should be alternated every other week to decrease insects from becoming resistant to them in the vegetable garden. For the mechanical controls, you should go through the plants and remove as many of the eggs that you can find or see. The squash bugs typically lay their eggs on the underside of the squash leaves. When walking through your squash patch, once you flip over those leaves you will be able to see the small eggs laid underneath the leaves. The eggs are usually in clusters and have a copper color to them. You can not simply just brush these eggs off the plant and into the soil because they can still hatch in the soil. Travis likes to take a piece of duct tape and wrap it around his fingers with the sticky side up. Then he walks through his garden and simply pats those eggs with the duct tape and they will stick to the duct tape. He recommends going through the patch at least once every other day to look for eggs underneath the squash leaves and remove them when they are present. This should be done frequently because the eggs only take seven to eight days to hatch, so they should be removed from the garden before they hatch and start to cause serious problems. Once the squash bugs become fully mature and are in their adult stages they are nearly impossible to kill. These adult stages will overwinter then cause more problems in the vegetable garden if they are not killed. So when controlling squash bugs use the IPM (Integrated Pest Management) strategy such as organic chemicals like Neem Oil and Take Down Garden Spray to kill the eggs early on and avoid serious problems in the vegetable garden in the future.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7IO3sPEHhM&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=39&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "Removing Tomato Plants the Proper Way",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:06-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Removing Tomato Plants</h2>\nMost crops like tomatoes, potatoes, or squash are highly susceptible to disease and insect pressure. When removing tomato plants is very important to remove them in a proper way because if they are not cleaned out of the garden insect eggs and fungal spores can overwinter and begin to cause major issues in the garden area. Proper disposal of diseased plants is important to maintain health in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Tips for Removing Tomato Plants</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the importance of removing tomato plants once the crop is done producing in the vegetable garden. When you finish harvesting tomatoes to avoid future problems with the pests and diseases it is highly recommended to clean out that area in the garden. If you do not clean the area out after harvesting, it could become infected with insect eggs and fungal spores that overwinter in the soil and can cause serious problems in the future gardening seasons. The most known pests problems that tomatoes experience are whiteflies, hornworms, and aphids. The most common fungal disease is late blight which can leave moldy spots on tomatoes and mostly come up when there is constant damp weather. Another disease is mosaic virus which creates distorted yellow leaves and should be removed properly to avoid problems in the future too. In the video below, Travis demonstrates how to properly remove and clear the garden area after harvesting tomatoes. He currently has some indeterminate tomatoes that are surrounded by our <a href=\"/products/tomato-cages/\">tomato cages</a>. The tomato cages are used to help support the tomato plants and keep them from growing on the ground which provides better air circulation, fewer disease pressures, and cleaner fruits for harvesting. Travis likes to take <a href=\"/products/pruning-shears/\">pruning shears</a> and cut the stems about 10 inches above the soil line. This will allow him to pull the cages right up out of the soil and lay them on the ground out of the garden area. Once the cages are removed he can go along the row and pull the root mass out of the soil which will clear out the garden. For his determinate tomatoes that are on the Florida Weave trellis, he prefers to take his knife and simply cut the <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">Gro-tine garden twine</a>. Then he will simply pull the entire plant up out of the ground and remove it from the garden area. When you remove all the plants from the ground you want to make sure you dispose of them the proper way. Avoid adding them to your compost pile because you will add insect or fungal spores to the compost that can then lead to serious problems as well. The proper way to dispose of these tomato plants is with a burn pile. If you burn them in a burn pile you will kill off all those insect eggs and fungal spores and they will no longer cause any pest or disease problems. If you have other crops like kale, lettuce, radishes, or broccoli you can till these crops back into the soil. The benefit of tilling these crops into the soil is they will add more organic matter back into the soil. The benefits of adding organic matter back into the soil will overall increase the soil nutrients and health in the garden. Tomatoes like most other crops should be rotated in the garden. If planted in the same spot year after year this will cause disease problems as well. As for the other insect and disease susceptible crops, these should be cleaned out and removed from the vegetable garden properly.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XbQgMmH1BI&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=40&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "Attracting Pollinators to Your Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:06-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Pollinators in the Garden</h2>\nMaintaining pollinators in the vegetable garden is important for the production of seeds and plant growth. Attracting pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds can allow for an optimal increase in benefits for the crops growing in the garden. In order for the movement of pollen to take place, the pollinators must move pollen from the male structure known as the anther to the female structure known as the stigma. This movement of pollen will create fertilization of the flower's eggs. Once this has taken place it will in return fertilize the flower and allow for the production of seeds and continue plant growth or reproduction in the garden. Another benefit of attracting pollinators into the garden is creating a bountiful vegetable harvesting. Many crops like squash, cucumbers, watermelons, pumpkins, blueberries, and apples all require insect pollination to make maximum production of fruits. The increase of pollinators will attract beneficial insects that help reduce other harmful pest pressures.\n<h2>Flowers in the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the advantages of attracting pollinators into your vegetable garden. Two different varieties of cut flowers that we like to plant are zinnias and sunflowers which allow for an increase of pollinators surrounding the garden. Zinnias take 75 days to maturity and sunflowers take 60 days to maturity. Travis's favorite zinnias to plant are the Benary Giant variety which we carry in many different colors variations such as <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-lime-zinnia/\">Lime</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-coral-zinnia/\">Coral</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-white-zinnia/\">White</a>, <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-scarlet-zinnia/\">Scarlet</a>, <a href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\">Orange</a>, and <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-wine-zinnia/\">Wine</a>. We also offer a <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-zinnia-mix/\">Benary Giant Zinnia Mix</a> that has several different colors all in one pack. One of the easiest cut flowers to grow, Zinnias produce vibrant flowers that are around three to four inches in diameter. They offer great storage potential that can store for up to several weeks in a mason jar or vase. Due to the papery texture and oddly shaped seed size, the zinnias cannot be planted in our walk-behind <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/walk-behind-garden-seeder-planter/\">garden seeder</a>. We recommend direct seeding or transplanting in the greenhouse. When transplanting in the greenhouse they work great in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>. Travis likes to plant most crops on double rows when possible so he takes his <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer</a> attachment and lays a line of drip tape which creates two little small furrows on both sides of the tape. The small furrows help with direct seeding because you can just move along and scatter the seeds along the furrow and lightly cover them. These seeds do not have to be evenly spaced along the furrow. The ProCut sunflowers are another popular cut flower variety for attracting pollinators. We offer these in several different color variations such as <a href=\"/products/procut-white-nite-sunflower/\">White Nite</a>, <a href=\"/products/procut-red-lemon-bicolor-sunflower/\">Red Lemon</a>, <a href=\"/products/procut-plum-sunflower/\">Plum</a>, <a href=\"/products/procut-lemon-sunflower/\">Lemon</a>, <a href=\"/products/procut-red-sunflower/\">Red</a>, and <a href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\">Orange</a>. When planting the ProCut sunflowers these can be planted with our garden seeder. So Travis likes to use the number three seed plate which is originally made for okra seeds, but if you drill them a little bigger they work perfectly for sunflower seeds. This variety of sunflowers will get up to around 6\" or 7\" inches tall and produce one flower per stem when growing in the garden. These ProCut sunflowers are pollenless meaning that once they are cut they will not drip pollen on your table. With the sunflowers, they only have a one-time harvest. However, the zinnias will continue to grow in the garden up until the first frost date. Not only will planting zinnias and sunflowers in the garden help with attracting pollinators for increase vegetable production, but they will also keep your garden beautiful and vibrant during the warmer summer months.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CqE6ziXPC_0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=41&amp;t=22s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Various Wheel Hoe Attachments</h2>\nThe most versatile and all-around best tools in the vegetable garden are our high-quality and most popular <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single</a>, <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double</a>, and <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch</a> Wheel Hoes. Whether you need to make a furrow, lay drip tape, hill or throw soil to plants the Wheel Hoe has several attachments that can save you time and energy when it comes to working in the vegetable garden. The <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\">oscillating hoe</a>, <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-sweeps-attachment/\">sweeps</a>, and <a href=\"/products/winged-sweeps/\">winged sweeps</a> attachments all work best for shallow or deeper cultivating and managing weeds inside of the garden. While the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set</a> offers an easy way to move soil to make furrows for planting, hilling beds, or throwing soil to plants to provide support in the garden. We also offer a <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer Attachment</a> that fits on our Double Wheel Hoe. This attachment makes laying drip tape down in the garden quick and easy. While normally it is a two-person job with the help of this attachment it turns it into a simple one-person job. Another popular attachment is our <a href=\"/products/dibble-wheel-attachment/\">Dibble Wheel</a> that helps with creating rows and making indentions in the soil for transplanting or direct seeding plants in the vegetable garden. These dibble wheels are adjustable for plant spacing of 4\",8\",12\",16\", 24\", and 48-inches. Other various attachments that work just as great on our Wheel Hoes include the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe-disk-harrow/\">Disk Harrow</a>, <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe-garden-seeder-attachment/\">Seeder Attachment</a>, and the individual <a href=\"/products/right-plow/\">Right</a> and <a href=\"/products/left-plow/\">Left Plow</a>.\n<h2>Most Useful Wheel Hoe Attachment</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis showcases the most underrated, but the most useful wheel hoe attachment is the <a href=\"/products/cultivator-teeth/\">Cultivator Teeth</a>. Whether you buy the Single, Double, or High Arch Wheel Hoe we include a set of cultivator teeth with every wheel hoe product. This attachment works best for breaking up crust after heavy rains or maybe just adding a little bit of soil to the plants. After a hard rain, Travis's favorite set up is to use a set of three cultivator teeth on the Single Wheel Hoe. He also recommends setting the middle tooth toward the front of the wheel hoe to help the soil to flow smoothly through the wheel hoe. This also helps allow weeds to not clog up there in the middle of the wheel hoe making it hard to use. The wheel hoe can hold up to five or six cultivator teeth on the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-tool-bar/\">wheel hoe toolbar</a>. However, Travis prefers to use only three teeth because it makes for better cultivation and allows for the soil to flow through the teeth freely. Once you have a heavy rain you should get out in the garden with this attachment and this will help prevent weed germination because weeds do not like to grow in loose fluffy soil. If you don't want to throw a large amount of soil to your plants or create a big hill you can use the double wheel hoe and put a tooth behind each wheel. Using this type of setup will allow you to straddle a row of younger plants and work both sides of the plant in one pass through. This will only throw a little amount of soil to the row in order to cover the weeds and support the plant growth in the garden. Another advantage of these cultivator teeth is you can take one tooth and mark a row for planting or make a small furrow for planting a row of seeds that you typically may direct seed in the garden. The cultivator teeth are the most useful wheel hoe attachment due to the many different variations and ways that it can be used in the vegetable garden.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qLoAYjaImx4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=42&amp;t=3s",

    "title": "Best Fertilizer Injector for the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:05-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Fertilize Your Vegetable Garden?</h2>\nThere are several benefits and advantages to fertilizing your vegetable garden. The major benefit of applying fertilizers to your vegetable garden is they contain nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Most plants in the garden require a certain amount of these key macronutrients to develop strong plant growth within the vegetable garden. Supplying the macronutrients through the use of fertilizer is an easy way to help establish a significant amount of these much-needed nutrients. Another advantage is these macronutrients will increase soil nutrients as well. Like plants, various soil types need nutrients to help supply the plant roots for future plant growth in the garden.\n<h2>Best Fertilizer Injector</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the easiest and best way to fertilize your garden. The first step in having an easy fertilizer program for the garden is using the best fertilizer injector which is our <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo Fertilizer Injector</a>. Works well with any type of water-soluble fertilizer like <a href=\"/products/liqui-fish-garden-fertilizer/\">Liqui-Fish</a> or <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a>. This fertilizer injector will allow you to water and fertilize simultaneously ensuring a constant proportion is being applied to the plants in the garden. This injector is a tank that you fill with fertilizer and it contains a line with water coming inside the tank then back out with the fertilizer. This fertilizer injector will work perfectly with any water-soluble fertilizers. Travis prefers using our blue colored 20-20-20. With equal amounts of phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium the <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20 garden fertilizer</a> provides a balance of nutrients that are needed for plant growth. This garden fertilizer can also be dissolved and injected into the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation system</a>. Around 5,000 square feet, Travis's has found that in his garden plot the easiest way to apply this fertilizer is to take a 2-quart container and fill it about halfway with the dry 20-20-20 fertilizer. Next, he will add in water and let it dissolve into the 2-quart container. Once the fertilizer is dissolved he will pour it into the fertilizer injector and fill the tank up with water. The fertilizer injector has four different speeds for how slow or fast you would like to apply the fertilizer in the garden. Travis likes to use the fastest speed setting because it normally takes around two or three hours to empty the injector tank of fertilizer into his garden. This is visible in the lines coming from the tank because once the line becomes clear there is only water left in the tank since the fertilizer is a blue color. Now when you are done fertilizing for that particular day whether you used all the fertilizer or not it is best to empty that injector tank. The reason for emptying out the tank after using it is because that injector tank does not need to be under constant pressure so it is better to disconnect at least one of the lines. Disconnecting one of the lines will stop the constant pressure and allow you to water for the rest of the week. Another reason you should empty that tank is algal buildup will eventually clog up some of the lines. It's important to empty the fertilizer injector and keep it clean to avoid this buildup and clear for future use. You can use this injector for overhead irrigation, but it is more effective with drip irrigation. The drip irrigation will allow you to put the water and fertilizer right to the plant roots, unlike overhead watering. If you would like to save time and money using the EZ-Flo Fertilizer Injector will help save time and money when watering and fertilizing simultaneously instead of separately in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urDvgojwF0A&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=43&amp;t=97s",

    "title": "Organic Methods to Help Control Garden Pest and Diseases",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:05-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Organic Methods in the Garden</h2>\nWhen growing your own food in the vegetable garden one of the most important tasks is keeping the garden clear of any harsh chemicals and never spraying too many pesticides or fertilizers. The more organic products that we use will allow for a healthier garden and better quality produce. The great thing about all the products mentioned below is they are all-natural or organic methods and they're not toxic to the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Insect Pressures</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the benefits of using all natural or organic methods to help control garden pests and diseases. With any type of pest control whether it is organic or conventional, it's always important to have a program set in place for your garden so you have a system for rotating these different products instead of using the same ones repeatedly. If you use the same products over and over again that insect or disease is going to become resistant to that certain product. Travis likes to use <a href=\"/products/take-down-garden-spray/\">Take Down Garden Spray</a> and <a href=\"/products/neem-oil/\">Neem Oil</a> for insect control. The Take Down Garden Spray has a mixture of natural pyrethrin and canola oil which provides quick control over insects like aphids, beetles, ants, whiteflies, etc. This pesticide can be used on various crops and fruit trees like apples, figs, peaches, etc. This can be used inside, outside, or in the greenhouse. The Neem Oil is an OMRI registered product that has been derived from the neem tree. Mainly used for controlling fungal diseases like blight, black spot, rust, and powdery/downy mildew. Travis recommends rotating these two products to get the most effective control results in the garden. So the first week he recommends spraying Take Down Garden Spray, then the next week spray Neem Oil. If the insect pressure becomes extremely bad and hard to control then you should increase the frequency of spraying to more than once a week.\n<h2>Fungal Diseases</h2>\nWhen it comes to fungal diseases they recommended alternating between the <a href=\"/products/complete-disease-control/\">Complete Disease Control</a> and <a href=\"/products/bi-carb-fungicide/\">Bi-Carb</a>. The Complete Disease Control helps colonize plant root hairs and prevent fungi and bacterial diseases from establishing. When used as a foliar spray application it can control powdery mildews, leaf spots, gray mold, etc. If applied as a soil drench it can help with diseases on plant roots or other parts of the plant in contact with soil. The natural Bi-Carb helps control powdery mildew on vegetables, fruit trees, and ornamentals. This is an OMRI registered fungicide as well. Travis likes to mix the Complete Disease Control and the Bi-Carb fungicide together and then along with that a little bit of  <a href=\"/products/monterey-b-t/\">Monterey B.t</a> for complete control. B.t. is another OMRI registered product that is great for controlling larval worms, caterpillars, or moths from snacking on the plants. It should be sprayed early on and repeated at weekly intervals to maintain control over these larval insects. Overall, since all these pesticides and fungicides are concentrated it does not take much to mix these together into our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-sprayer/\">garden sprayer</a> to get control over the pests and diseases in the garden. Most of these mix together with a ratio of one or two ounces of a gallon. So in a pint container, this will give you around 16 applications to spray in the garden. When treating your vegetable garden for pests and diseases you should be mindful of the chemicals you choose to spray. It is better for the vegetable garden if you always use organic methods for control and rotate those products in order to keep pests or diseases from becoming resistant.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsd6oDMtw38&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=44&amp;t=84s",

    "title": "Harvesting Kale During the Summer Growing Months",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:04-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Different Kale Varieties in the Garden</h2>\nAs part of the cabbage family, Kale is a more hardy, cool weather crop that typically grows best in the spring and the fall growing months. Which means growing kale in the summer is a benefit because most other vegetables cannot be planted during these months due to the harsh hot and dry temperatures. Travis explains that his favorite kale to grow in the vegetable garden is Toscano or sometimes referred to as Lacinato Kale. An Italian heirloom, <a href=\"/products/lacinato-kale/\">Lacinato Kale</a> is one of the most productive crops. This variety produces long, slender, blue-greenish leaves that have a slight crinkle to the foliage. This variety is great prepared in raw salads or also added into soups and sauteed vegetables. These kale varieties can either be direct seeded or transplanted. However, Travis prefers to transplant these different varieties due to quicker germination and consistent plant spacing in the garden. We offer other kale, colored varieties such as <a href=\"/products/blue-knight-kale/\">Blue Knight</a>, <a href=\"/products/red-russian-kale/\">Red Russian</a>, and <a href=\"/products/scarlet-kale/\">Scarlet Kale</a>. The Blue Knight is a hybrid variety that has increased productivity with a deeper blue coloration. With a crisp and crinkled appearance, this variety works great in raw kale salad mixtures. The Red Russian has purple veins that become darker in colder temperatures. These leaves contain a thinner leaf that can be more tender than most other kale varieties. Scarlet has a darker red color blend with blue-green coloration in the center of the leaf that becomes stronger in colder temperatures as well. This variety contains many antioxidants and vitamins that are full of nutrients. All of these varieties are cold-tolerant and are bolt resistant which makes them perfect to grow on into the summer months.\n<h2>Harvesting &amp; Growing Kale</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis talks about how to properly harvest kale so you can get a repeat harvest throughout the spring and into the summer months in the garden. Plants that are planted in the early spring like lettuce and other greens should be harvested or they will bolt once it becomes hotter temperatures. However, Kale is an exception to these other crops because we can plant it in the early spring and it will continue to grow into the summer. Another benefit of growing kale is it typically will not bolt and has multiple harvesting times. When harvesting different kale varieties it is best to pull the stalks down instead of up. If you pull up on the leaves when harvesting you will risk uprooting the kale plant. So it is better to harvest the bottom leaves of the kale that way the plant can continue to photosynthesize and grow. Leaving at least four or five leaves at the top will help ensure over time the stalks will continue to produce leaves. Sometimes they will get two or three inches tall as you continue to harvest the kale throughout the growing season. Travis recommends using plastic produce bags like at the grocery store to store away bunches of kale. Just put a few bunches of kale leaves in the bag then poke a few holes for ventilation and store away in the fridge for up to a week. After multiple harvests, plants can resemble mini palm trees with stalks that continue to grow upward and produce new leaves. These stalks can sometimes reach up to four or five inches tall. There are many benefits to growing kale but the biggest advantage is growing these varieties in the early spring and up into the summer months allows for harvesting vegetable crops when many other vegetables cannot be grown during these summer months.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1Ht-DRkuyY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=45&amp;t=37s",

    "title": "Controlling Grass from Sneaking into the Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:04-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Grass Shouldn't Surround the Edge of the Garden</h2>\nA problem that can mostly cause issues surrounding the edges of our garden is grass. When grass begins to sneak in and around the edges of the garden it starts out by just a few runners here and there. Then if these grass runners are not controlled they will establish themselves and basically become weeds which are a bigger problem in the vegetable garden. In the South, these weeds are bermudagrass or centipede grass which can become really persistent, invasive, and overall hard to get rid of if you do not eliminate or control them early on in the garden. There are many ways to eliminate grass from sneaking into the garden, but the best way is with our Hoss Wheel Hoe with either the oscillating hoe or sweeps attachment connected.\n<h2>Best Tool for Controlling Grass</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the best tool for controlling the persisting grass that surrounds the edge of the vegetable garden. There are several tools that can help control these grass issues around the garden such as a gas-powered edger or even a sharp machete. The best tool to use for controlling grass in the garden is our popular <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/wheel-hoes/\">Wheel Hoes</a> with a couple of attachments. Our Hoss Wheel Hoe is the ultimate garden tool when it comes to saving time cultivating or weeding in the garden. Along with the wheel hoe, there are several attachments that fit perfectly onto this tool that can be used to make gardening quicker and easier. Two attachments that will be a great asset to help you control grass from sneaking in the garden is our <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\">oscillating hoe</a> and our <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-sweeps-attachment/\">sweeps attachment</a>. Both of these attachments will also work on the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a>, <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a>, and the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a>. Both attachments contain a sharp blade that allows you to cut those runners out of the edge surrounding your garden. They provide a blade not only on the bottom of the attachment but on the curved edge or side of the attachment too. This will help maintain a nice clean edge and eliminate and cut out all existing grass runners. If your grass pressure is not that high and you only have a few runners coming in the garden you can use the sweeps. The sweeps have a 7-inch long cutting blade that has a maximum of 14-inch cutting path when turned inward for a stirrup hoe setup. Turn these sweeps outward when wanting to eliminate weeds close to the plants without damaging the feeder roots of the plant or damaging the stalks and stems. The sweeps will cut down any of the shallow weeds or smaller runners that are surrounding the edges of the garden. While the oscillating hoes will take care of the more thicker runners that are causing a heavy pressure of grass to sneak into the garden. The oscillating hoe comes in a 6-inch, 8-inch, or 12-inch length size. Although Travis recommends and prefers the 8-inch for edging grass runners along the garden sides and surrounding the garden rows. He also recommends running the wheel hoe with either the oscillating or sweeps attachment at least once a week to maintain a clean edge and keep the grass to a minimum surrounding the garden. Whether you have a single wheel hoe, double wheel hoe, or high arch wheel hoe the oscillating hoe attachment or the sweeps attachments are a must-have accessory when it comes to effectively keeping the garden manageable, maintaining cleanliness, and enjoying your plants all throughout the growing season.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zs1dmd8nwZY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=46&amp;t=58s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:04-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Increasing Quality and Flavor of Vegetables</h2>\n<p>When deciding when crops are ready for harvesting in the garden that can be sometimes tricky. Many factors like various maturity dates, weather conditions or temperatures can cause a delay in harvesting these vegetable crops. Most crops have either a one-time harvesting or multiple harvesting times. When it comes to a one-time harvest that means that these crops are only harvested once and they do not continue to grow in the garden. While on the other hand, multiple harvestings mean that these crops can be picked more than once or more frequently due to their continuous growth in the vegetable garden.</p>\n<h2>Harvesting Vegetables</h2>\n<p>On this week's episode, Travis is discussing the techniques of harvesting vegetables with multiple harvesting times. When growing your own food you want to produce the best quality, flavor, and maximum production of those crops that you can grow in the garden. There are several crops that can be harvested one time or harvested multiple times in the garden. Some of those harvested one-time crops include <a title=\"Watermelon\" href=\"/collections/watermelon\" target=\"_blank\">watermelons</a>, <a title=\"Corn\" href=\"/collections/corn\" target=\"_blank\">corn</a>, <a title=\"Winter Squash\" href=\"/collections/winter-squash\" target=\"_blank\">winter squash</a>, etc. However, some crops need to be harvested more frequently and have multiple harvesting times throughout the growing season. These crops include potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, okra, eggplants, peppers, etc. It is important that the crops that need to be harvested more frequently are picked at their peak quality and are not left in the garden to get bigger. For example, Tempest Squash should be harvested once they reach about 5 or 6 inches long in size. This squash size offers the best flavor profile and is the perfect size to eat. However, if you continue to let tempest squash grow in the garden and it becomes too big and loses its flavor profile. Another example is zucchini, it should be harvested the same 5 or 6 inches long in size in order to get the best quality and flavor according to Travis. In order to harvest these vegetable crops at the highest quality or flavor profile, you should harvest them frequently from the garden. If you allow for the vegetables to get too big they can become pithy or spongy which can cause a decrease in flavor and quality. When it comes to harvesting <a title=\"Cucumbers\" href=\"/collections/cucumbers\" target=\"_blank\">cucumbers</a> and squash, Travis likes to pick them at least every other day or sometimes every day. Sometimes when going through the garden you can miss one or two vegetables, but you can always harvest them in the next picking the next day. Harvesting okra is the same way as cucumbers and squash. The recommend size to harvest okra is once it reaches about the size of your pinky finger, but not larger than that. He explains that is the perfect size to pick for cooking okra. If you let them get bigger than the size of your pinky finger the skin can become too tough and they will lose flavor as well. Travis recommends harvesting crops like pepper or eggplant at least twice a week. He likes to harvest all of these regardless of the size they may be because they tend to have better quality. Harvesting so frequently will help ensure that the vegetables will not become too big and they stay on smaller size with better flavor and quality. Travis recommends keeping these frequent harvesting vegetables in mind when planting because you don't need to plant so many that you cannot keep up with harvesting them all. So when picking those multiple harvest crops make sure to pick them early and smaller size to ensure you get the best quality and flavor prolific vegetables from the garden.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWcIb4nvg8U?si=EKWF7Sn-cHA7W2mT\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:03-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Weed Control</h2>\nTaking control of weeds is important because they are unwanted plant growth that will cause many issues in the vegetable garden. These weeds can cause restricts on plant growth due to them competing for nutrients, soil, water, and space that the plants you are trying to get growing need more than the weeds. Another issue with weeds in the garden is they may even smother smaller plants that are trying to germinate or prevent them from growing at all. Also, some invasive weeds can destroy a habitat and damage all the native plants that grow there. To avoid these harsh and invasive weeds it is best to remove them quickly before they become a bigger problem, germinate to spread, and destroy the natural plant habitat in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>In-Row Weeding in the Garden</h2>\nIt's no secret that when using our <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Hoss Wheel Hoe</a> between our rows it helps decrease and control weeds in the garden perfectly. However, what about the in-row weeding or weeding in between plants along the row as opposed to between rows. With in-row weeding, it can be a little more delicate task than just simply weeding around the garden with the wheel hoe. With closely-spaced crops like onions, carrots, beets, or garlic a small tool that does not have several sharp edges is needed to control those weeds around these crops. In-row weeding is the process of weeding in between and as close to plants without damaging those plant stems or stalks. Due to the sharp edges that can surround a traditional hoe or wheel hoe, we can not use them for in-row weeding because there is a high risk of nicking and damaging one or several of the plants. Travis explains that his favorite tool for in-row weeding is the <a href=\"/products/single-tine-cultivator/\">Single Tine Cultivator</a>. A multifunctional tool that can help with close weeding, cultivating, and various other garden techniques. This single tine cultivator has a sharp pointed blade at the end that allows you to dig and uproot smaller or larger weeds surrounding those plants in the garden. The single tine cultivator also contains a cylindrical curved shank that allows you to work closely next to the plants without damaging the stems or stalks. However, the curved part of the shank should face the stems and stalks, not the sharply pointed blade. You can turn the blade on its side to skim the top of the soil for shallow cultivation and removal of shallow-rooted weeds. Another benefit of this tool is the narrow blade has the ability to create a furrow for smaller seeds in the garden. We also carry this Single Tine Cultivator in a short handle version known as the <a href=\"/products/short-single-tine-cultivator/\">Short Single Tine Cultivator</a>. Same design as the long handle single tine cultivator, just with a shorter handle for easier in-row weeding and cultivating in raised garden beds or elevated gardens. The shorter handle also works great for individuals that are not as tall and like to work closely in the garden. The longer handle is 54 inches and the shorter handle is 18 inches. However, the blade width is 5/8 inches on both versions. The blades are made out of high-carbon steel that can be sharpened using our <a href=\"/products/farmers-file/\">Farmer's File</a>. The top-notch quality of the Single Tine Cultivator will become your favorite tool when it comes to weeding and cultivating inside your vegetable garden or raised beds.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9tgFQbTmic&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=48&amp;t=56s",

    "title": "Why You Should Avoid Buying Plants from Big Box Stores",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:03-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Growing Your Own Vegetable Transplants</h2>\nThe benefits of growing your own vegetable plants in the garden will always hold an advantage over buying plants from big box stores. Some benefits include the ability to control what type of pesticide or fertilizer chemicals are being sprayed on your crop which will in return produce healthier plants and provide maximum production of crops when growing from your own vegetable garden.\n<h2>Home Gardening vs. Store Bought Crops</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis goes over the benefits of growing your own vegetable transplants. There are major differences when it comes to growing your own and buying plants from big box stores like Home Depot, Lowe's, or a local feed and seed store. Travis showcases two of his transplanted pepper plants and two that he purchased from a big box store. The pepper plants that he personally grew he planted in our <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting trays</a>, then transplanted them from the greenhouse into the garden once they were ready. The ones he bought from the big box stores came in a biodegradable pot with a plant that was about a foot tall. In the video, it is noticeable that the plants from the store have not grown much since begin transplanted in the garden. These plants from the store are not looking healthy and producing a little amount of fruit on the plants. While the ones that were grown by ourselves have grown healthy and made great production yields thus far in the garden. While the store bought plants may look appealing at the store they will not remain healthy once transplanted in the garden and production will not surpass the pepper transplants that were grown by the home gardener in the greenhouse. Another advantage is you will save more money and get more plants if you grow your own. You are saving money by getting more production by planting plants in the seed starting trays. When planting in the seed starting tray not only do these trays contain 162 cells for transplanting plants, but they also offer effective root growth due to the internal vertical root training ribs. This trains the plant roots to grow downwards instead of wrapping around the plant and becoming root bound. This seed tray will also help with soil aeration and root ball drainage. This will allow for less transplant shock and quicker production of crops. These seed starting trays will also allow you to get a head start on the growing season. Having seeds already planted in these trays they will be ready to go in the ground whenever weather or temperature conditions are just right. You also don't have to only grow what is available or what you can find at the big box store. Another benefit to growing your own food is producing healthier and fresher crops. When home gardeners are producing their own crops they can control the frequency and what types of pesticides and fertilizers they are spraying in their garden. Most of the home gardeners are only spraying their plants with all-natural or organic chemicals because they are healthier for the plant and the garden pollinators like bees. The plants are fresher due to them not being overly sprayed with insecticides, pesticides, and fertilizers as well. In commercially grown farming they have a tendency to overuse these chemical products due to them trying to maintain quicker and faster production. Also, to keep the product in good condition for supermarket purposes and standards. Overall, growing your own food can have many more advantages and better results than just buying plants from the big box stores.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaWTTdKIlls\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=49&amp;t=32s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:45:02-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Correct Irrigation Amounts</h2>\nDepending on the size of your personal garden and the accurate water amounts a certain crop needs can all vary drastically from each vegetable garden. Other factors such as soil type and weather conditions can play in a key role in how frequent and when you should be watering or fertilizing the crops. If it is hot or dry you may have to water more depending on the weather conditions. However, if it becomes too wet you will need to reduce watering till soil conditions dry out. Also, the best time to water is either early morning or late afternoon so the plants will effectively absorb the water given. The well-known recommendation when it comes to how much water should plants receive is about 2 inches once a week which will increase stronger root growth. Applying accurate water amounts to certain crops is important for the overall growing health of the plants in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Basics of Watering Certain Garden Crops</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is explaining the accurate water amounts you should be using to irrigate crops in the vegetable garden. He explains ways to customize your water and fertilizer system depending on your personal garden plot, garden rows, and crops. Our favorite method for watering and fertilizing crops in the garden is by using our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation system</a>. Using drip tape allows each crop in the garden a suffocation amount of water because all the water is going directly to the plant's roots, unlike overhead watering. This is the most effective and efficient way of watering in the vegetable garden. However, there is always some crops that may need more water or fertilizer than other crops. For example, if you plant okra next to corn in your garden one is more of a heavy-feeder than the other. Okra is not a heavy-feeder meaning it does not need a lot of water or fertilizer. On the other hand, corn is a heavy-feeder and does require a lot of water and fertilizer. The most effective and easiest way to deal with these problems is by using our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-start-valve/\">Drip Tape Row Start Valve</a> or the <a href=\"/products/mainline-connector-valve/\">Mainline Connector Valve</a>. The Drip Tape Row Start Valve allows you to easily control flow on individual drip irrigation tape lines. This is ideal for controlling accurate amounts of water between crops or rows that may need more water than other crops in the garden. This contains a 1/4\" barb that perfectly connects to our <a href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\">Mainline Tubing</a>. This also works for controlling certain amounts of fertilizer. You can turn the valve off and on depending on certain rows or crops that may need fertilizer while other crops or row do not need fertilizer. Another way to control water or fertilizer amounts is with the Mainline Connector Valve which connects two lines of 5/8\" mainline tubing of drip tape. This valve allows you to shut off or turn on certain sections in the garden rows to water or fertilize. This valve can also be used with the <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo Fertilizer Injector</a> so you can only fertilize certain crops like the heavy-feeders such as corn or onions. These valves will allow you to break up your garden into zones and you can control based on turning on and off portions that need more water or fertilizer depending on the certain crops in the garden. They contain easy lock barbs and nuts that will help secure and seal them from leaking. These Drip Tape Row Start Valves and Mainline Connector Valves are great tools to customize your drip irrigation system and accurately water and fertilize all the crops in the garden.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KM08saRsqmI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=50&amp;t=46s",

We hope that through these videos you will learn the simplest way of gardening that will save you time and money in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Changing Between Various Water Hoses and Sprinkler Nozzles</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the simplest way of using a <a href=\"/products/brass-quick-hose-connect/\">Brass Hose Quick Connect</a> that will make switching between garden hoses and sprinkler nozzles a quick task in the garden. Changing between various water hoses and sprinkler nozzles in the garden can be a hassle due to the various twisting of threads and having to turn the water off and on every time you decide to switch between water systems. Very similar to an air hose fittings the brass hose quick connect has a male and female piece end. The female piece has ball bearings that allow the smaller male piece to fit perfectly and securely together with the female piece. When the larger female ball bearings slide into the smaller male piece that has a divot ring around the fitting the connection is secure and will not leak. Travis demonstrates how to connect and detach the two pieces in the video below. Travis believes it works best if your garden is broken up into subplots the main reason being for manageable and better crop rotation instead of having one massive garden plot with longer rows. Moving your water hose from one subplot to the next can be difficult without this quick hose fitting that allows you to detach and connect to the next watering set up quickly and save time irrigating the water into your garden. However, with this hose quick connect you can save time and easily irrigate each subplot without the hassle of twisting threads onto another hose, sprinkler nozzle, or drip irrigation system every time. Not only will this hose quick connect work on water hoses and sprinkle nozzles it will work perfectly on <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> systems and our <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo Fertilizer Injector</a>. Switching between your drip irrigation to a water sprinkler for hand-watering in the garden you can easily connect and disconnect the hose quick connect male and female fittings. Another advantage to this Brass Hose Quick Connect is you do not have to turn the water off and on every time you decide to switch between water hoses, sprinkler nozzles, or drip irrigation systems in the vegetable garden. Due to the secure fitting connection between the male and female piece the water won't leak out when swapping between the different watering systems. Travis likes to even use these quick connects on his four-way at his well system so he can easily switch between his fertilizer injector and just straight water from his well system. This Brass Hose Quick Connect works on any standard garden hose and is durable, leak-proof, and rust proof. Overall, if you are tired of hassling between various water hoses and sprinkler nozzles the Brass Hose Quick Connect will allow you to switch between these various watering systems with fast and easy results with no hassle at all and save you the most time in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egTi2ZgNwI&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST84ZMPjNfBbsVsB6xn7dGCa&amp;index=51&amp;t=0s",

    "title": "Vegetable Gardening with the FAD System",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:43:42-04:00",
    "body_html": "Here at Hoss Tools, we are firm believers in the FAD System for vegetable gardening. FAD is an acronym that stands for <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>F</strong></span>urrow, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>A</strong></span>mend and <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>D</strong></span>rip. If you do these three things every time you plant something in your vegetable garden, you'll be on the fast track to success. Don't be fooled by the name -- this is not a \"fad\" that will be temporarily popular and short-lived. The FAD system is a proven technique that makes gardening easier and will drastically increase results. Let's talk about each step in detail and the particular order in which they should be performed.\n<h2>Details of the FAD System</h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_32734\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-32734\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3492-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"> Furrowing with the Plow Set[/caption]\n<h3>Furrow</h3>\nCreating a furrow lays the groundwork for the remaining two portions of the FAD system for your vegetable garden. The furrow marks the location of your row(s) where your crops will be planted. The furrow doesn't have to be extremely deep -- a furrow that's about 4-5\" deep will suffice. Our favorite tool for creating a furrow is the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">Plow Set</a> Attachment. If you need assistance pushing a straight line with the Double Wheel Hoe, you can use a string ran between two stakes to help guide you along a straight-line path.\n<h3>Amend</h3>\nOnce the furrow has been constructed, it's now time to amend that furrow with some quality compost. Instead of amending the entire garden with compost, we only amend the furrow where the seed/plants will be planted. This conserves compost by only placing it exactly where the plants can utilize it. Quality compost has many benefits in the vegetable garden. It adds organic matter which helps condition and soften the soil over time, it provides a fertile bed for the plants that will be soon growing in it, and it also can provide essential nutrients such as calcium which can help to prevent deficiencies such as blossom end rot. We recommend a compost with an animal-based component such as chicken manure or cow manure.\n<h3>Drip</h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_32735\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-32735\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3412-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"> Applying Drip Tape[/caption]\n\nThe final step in the FAD system for your vegetable garden is <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a>. Drip irrigation is by far the easiest and most efficient way to water your vegetable garden. Drip tape places water exactly where the plants need it -- at the roots. We recommend burying drip tape in the furrow with our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer Attachment</a>, which has many benefits. Burying drip tape virtually eliminates any source of evaporation that could result from laying the drip tape on top of the soil, so that all the water output is available for absorption by plant roots. Burying the tape also makes installation much easier because it is fastened in place by the soil on top and it can't be twisted by the wind. Finally, burying the tape keeps any rodents from chewing into the tape that might be easily accessible on top of the soil.\n\nThe FAD System is your best bet for long-term success in your vegetable garden. The compost will provide benefits to your plants throughout the entire growing season and the drip irrigation will provide efficient and effective delivery of water to your garden plants. If you'd like to see it in action, take a look at the Sweet Potato Planting video below where we implement all three portions of the FAD system for your vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFdJdw_apIE",

    "body_html": "[caption id=\"attachment_32155\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-32155\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/tomato-cages-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"> Square Tomato Cages[/caption]\n\nBecause the fruits can get so large and heavy, tomatoes are one of those plants in your vegetable garden that require some form of trellising or support. Trellising keeps the plant upright and prevents the stems from breaking during any high periods of wind. It's also important to trellis tomatoes so that you keep the plant leaves off the ground, which helps to reduce any possible plant diseases that may develop from excess ground moisture. From our experience, the two most effective tomato trellising techniques are using sturdy, square cages and using twine weaved between plants. We use both techniques in our garden, but for different situations.\n\nUsing cages to trellis tomatoes is a great technique for several different situations. If you grow 10 or less tomato plants, cages are probably the most feasible option for you. <a href=\"/products/tomato-cages/\">High-quality, square tomato cages</a> provide support around the entire plant. They are easy to install by simply pushing them into the ground over the top of young tomato plants, and these sturdy cages are galvanized and made to last for many years and gardens to come. Cages also work particularly well for large, indeterminate varieties such as Roma or Yellow Pear. For these varieties, the plant will grow continuously throughout the warm season until it is removed or killed by cold temperatures. Because of the increased plant size, taller cages work best to support these massive plants with such a large bounty of fruit.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_32157\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-32157\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/florida-weave-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"> Florida Weave Tomato Trellis[/caption]\n\nThe other proven option for tomato trellising is called the \"Florida Weave\". This technique consists of using stakes along the row and weaving twine between the plants and each stake. The Florida Weave is a great way to trellis tomatoes if you grow many tomatoes along a row. In this case, the number of cages required to support each plant might not be feasible, so the twine trellis makes more sense. We use metal t-posts and wooden stakes along the row, then weave twine around the plants and posts to support the plants. You can use <a href=\"/products/cotton-butcher-twine/\">cotton twine</a> or <a href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine/\">commercial-grade, polymer twine</a> to trellis tomatoes using the \"Florida Weave\". In addition to being a great option for large growers, this option works great for determinate tomato varieties that have a limited lifespan.\n\nCheck out the video below where we show you how to do the Florida Weave technique.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6YDs_b6Kow&amp;t=2s",

In order to maximize that space, it's important that we grow as intensively as possible to get the most from our garden plots. There are several techniques that can be used to grow more intensively while allowing room for walkways and harvesting. The <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Wheel Hoe</a> is a great tool for growing intensively because it requires minimal space to work between rows. As opposed to a gas-powered tiller or a tractor, the Wheel Hoe requires much less space to operate. Another great technique for intensive planting is double-row planting.\n\nDouble-row planting, as the name suggests, involves planting two rows about 8\" apart. The double-row technique allows you to grow two rows in almost the same amount of space as one row would require. You can harvest either row from either side of the double-row, thus conserving space in your garden. As the plants grow and a foliage canopy develops between the double rows, you also get the benefit of reduced weed pressure. We like to use <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> in conjunction with the double-row planting for maximal success. We bury the drip tape in our desired location and use the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> to plant on both sides of the drip tape.\n\nWe've experimented with double-row planting on many crops in our vegetable garden. It works well for onions, carrots, radishes, beets, okra, beans, peas and zinnias. It doesn't work well for crops that require significant amount of space such as potatoes, squash, tomatoes, or for crops that require room for pollination such as corn. But for all of the other crops mentioned above, it is a proven method for maximizing the growing potential of your garden space. Here's a great video showing how we perform double-row planting on bush beans in our vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99glPYJlWc8&amp;t=12s",

You have to move the sprinkler around the garden every few hours and you always end up watering areas outside the garden that don't need watering. If the wind is blowing, you can forget a consistent watering pattern. Stop wasting water. Water your garden more effectively, consistently and conservatively with drip tape irrigation.\n\nDrip tape functions similar to a soaker hose, but much more reliably. Unlike a soaker hose that inconsistently emits water along the length of the hose, drip tape has emitters with specific spacing along the length of the tape. Our drip tape has emitters with a 12\" interval spacing, which works great for both transplants and direct-seeded crops. For transplanted crops like tomatoes, peppers and eggplant, you can use the emitter spacing to help determine where to place your transplants. For example, if you plant your tomatoes on 2' spacing, you would just plant a tomato transplant on top of every other emitter.  Drip tape is also more durable and doesn't clog over time like a soaker hose tends to do.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_31957\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-31957\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/15-mil-drip-tape-irrigation-kit-1-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"> 15 mil Drip Tape Irrigation Kit[/caption]\n\nWe recommend burying drip irrigation tape under the soil and planting directly on top of it. Burying the tape makes it easier to lay because the soil provides a downward weight on the tape, preventing it from twisting or moving as it would if it were on top of the soil. Burying also prevents rodents from chewing into the tape and creating leaks. And finally, burying the tape makes it easier to weed around your plants when they emerge because the tape is located directly under your plants. Our drip irrigation tape can be buried up to 6\" deep under the soil.\n\nOur drip tape is available in two different thicknesses, 8 mil and 15 mil. The 8 mil tape has a lifespan of one year or two growing seasons (spring and fall). This is ideal for annual plants in a vegetable garden where the crop rotation and plant spacing will change from one season to the next. The 15 mil tape has a lifespan of 5 years, which works great for perennials such as asparagus, blueberries, blackberries, etc. Both our 8 mil and 15 mil drip tape are available in convenient <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">kits</a> which include all the necessary components to establish a drip irrigation system. These kits include the necessary filter, pressure regulator, mainline tubing and enough fittings for 20 rows.\n\n ",

We look forward to the time of year when tassels and silks form on the corn plants, because we know this means corn pollination is occurring and it won't be long until we have fresh corn on the table. Corn is a heavy-feeding crop that requires quite a bit of water and nutrients to feed those tall plants and produce large, full ears of deliciousness. Adequate water in conjunction with proper corn pollination are the two essentials to producing beautiful ears of corn for summertime enjoyment.</p>\n<p>Corn is a self-pollinating plant. It produces a male flower, which is commonly referred to as a tassel, and a female flower, which is commonly referred to as the silks. In order for kernels of corn to be produced by the plant, the male flowers must pollinate the female flowers. The male flower is located at the very top of the plant whereas the female flower is formed along the stalk of the plant. The male flower contains the pollen, which is primarily spread by wind, that will be used to pollinate the female plant. When planting corn, it is important to plant at least three rows side by side to ensure adequate wind pollination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/corn-pollination-2.jpg\"><img height=\"225\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Tassels (Male Flower)\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/corn-pollination-2-300x225.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Tassels (Male Flower)</em></p>\n<p>The female flower, or silks, are threadlike projections from the actual ear or cob of the corn. Each thread or silk represents an individual kernel on that particular ear of corn. Therefore, if the corn pollination goes as planned and each silk is pollinated, you will have a full ear of corn. If you have ears of corn that are not completely full of kernels, it is likely that you didn't receive adequate pollination. While some might think that inadequate corn pollination is due to lack of wind or pollen distribution, it is more often a result of water-starved plants and the timing of female flower development.</p>\n<p>The silks contain the most water of any part of the corn plant. So if your corn plants are water-starved, the female flower will be slow to develop. As a result, the male flower will develop much sooner than the female flower, and the pollen will have fallen to the ground by the time the female flower develops. Providing enough water to your corn plants is very important because it helps maintain the rhythm of the development of the male and female flowers. Without any silks to be pollinated, the pollen on the male flower is wasted.</p>\n<h2>Use Drip Irrigation for Best Corn Pollination</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/corn-pollination-31.jpg\"><img height=\"225\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Silks (Female Flower)\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/corn-pollination-31-300x225.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Silks (Female Flower)</em></p>\n<p>Once corn plants become 4 to 5 feet tall, it can be difficult to provide enough water via an overhead source. Most of the water applied overhead will not reach the soil and will be lost to evaporation. Using drip irrigation for corn is a must here in the south. The drip tape irrigation allows us to put water directly where the plants need it. With the drip tape, we don't lose hardly any water to evaporation and almost all the water we deliver is received by the plant. Consider using drip irrigation next season to ensure you get plenty of water to your corn plants so that the timing of flower development will be correct and you'll have great, big ears of corn to eat in the summer.</p>",

Adding compost as a soil amendment before planting can definitely provide most of these required nutrients, but some crops will need additional fertilization throughout their growing cycle. Vegetable garden crops that can be enhanced by additional fertilization include tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and corn just to name a few. While there are many ways to administer fertilize to the plants in your vegetable garden, we have found that a garden fertilizer injector is by far the easiest and most effective.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A garden fertilizer injector allows you to inject soluble fertilizer into your water supply so that you provide nutrients to your plants while watering them, saving you time and energy in your vegetable garden. The dissolved fertilizer is injected through the water source at a controlled rate, so that you're able to administer it accurately and effectively. When used in combination with a drip irrigation system, you can administer fertilizer directly to the plant roots. This conserves fertilizer by only applying the fertilizer to areas of your garden where the plants can absorb it.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/garden-fertilizer-injector.jpg\"><img height=\"300\" width=\"225\" alt=\"garden-fertilizer-injector\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/garden-fertilizer-injector-225x300.jpg\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-13804\"></a></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">EZ-FLO Garden Fertilizer Injector</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our EZ-FLO Garden Fertilizer Injector is the best way we've found to fertilize our vegetable gardens! It has a heavy-duty, polyethylene tank that won't cave in high pressure conditions. It can be easily attached to any standard water hose either at the faucet or between two connecting hoses. Simply add your water soluble fertilizer to the tank, select the application ratio setting on the tank lid, and you're ready to fertilize while you water! It works great with the conventional 20-20-20 fertilizer blend used by many, but it also effectively administers fish emulsion for the organic farmer. Maximize the potential of your vegetable garden by providing all the right nutrients in all the right places!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p>",

Large weeds are competition for both the crops and the grower.\" While continuous light cultivation to prevent weeds is very ideal, we don't always stay on top of things in the never-ending weed game. Inevitably you're going to get weeds sprouting between the rows in your vegetable garden. And when you do, you're going to need an efficient means for eliminating them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have two different garden weeding attachments for the <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wheel-hoes/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hoss Wheel Hoe</a> - Sweeps and Oscillating Hoes. Our Sweeps are sold as a pair (left and right) and our Oscillating Hoes are available in three different blade sizes -- 6\", 8\" and 12\". Although these Wheel Hoe Attachments have the same garden weeding function, they each have unique features that might make one or the other perfect for you.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Garden Weeding with Sweeps</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/sweeps-drawing-row-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12009\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/sweeps-drawing-row-2-300x162.jpg\" alt=\"sweeps-drawing-row-2\" width=\"300\" height=\"162\"></a>Our <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-sweeps-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeps</a> attachment for the Hoss Wheel Hoes include a left and right weeding blade. These blades made of high carbon steel and are extremely sharp out of the box. The left and right blade have a slightly different angle, so that they can be overlapped without interfering with the other. This allows you to alter the weeding path when using the Sweeps. With the versatility afforded by the many attachment holes on Hoss Wheel Hoe tool bar,  you can arrange the Sweeps for a solid garden weeding path as narrow as 6\" all the way up to 12\". The Sweeps can also be configured for \"straddle-weeding\" with the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hoss Double Wheel Hoe</a>. Because of the space between the wheels, you can configure the Sweeps blades to extend outward towards the wheels, leaving a space in the middle to straddle your vegetable plants.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Garden Weeding with Oscillating Hoes</h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_12011\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/garden-weeding-hoe.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-12011\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/garden-weeding-hoe-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Garden Weeding Oscillating Hoe\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></a> Garden Weeding Oscillating Hoe[/caption]\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oscillating Hoes</a> (or stirrup hoes) are made with a powder coated steel frame and a sharpened, spring steel blade. Unlike the Sweeps, the Oscillating Hoe blades are sharp on both sides. This allows you to cut weeds while pushing the Wheel Hoe in a forward and backward motion down the row. As mentioned earlier, our Oscillating Hoes are a fixed width (6\", 8\" or 12\"). The width that's right for you will depend on your row spacing. With some crops like corn or beans with wider row spacing, you might choose the 12\" Oscillating Hoe. However, with crops like lettuce and greens that typically have narrower row spacing, the 6\" might be perfect.  By selecting our <a href=\"/products/spreader-bar-bonus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spreader Bar Bonus</a> option, you can also perform \"straddle-weeding\" with the 6\" Oscillating Hoes attached to the Hoss Double Wheel Hoe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To conclude, the Sweeps offer a little more versatility as far as different weeding width configurations. And while the Oscillating Hoes are a fixed width, they are sharp on both sides which allows you to cut forwards and backwards. The choice for you will depend on your growing situation. You can't go wrong with either option for garden weeding!</p>",

Because the tool bar on our Wheel Hoe has multiple attachment holes and slots, there are endless possibilities for configurations of our Wheel Hoe attachments. Regardless of your garden design and row spacing, you can configure a setup on the Wheel Hoe that will work for you. And because all attachments are easily interchangeable with only a 9/16\" wrench required, changing setups with our push cultivator is a breeze!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Hoss <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> and <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> include a set of 3 cultivator teeth and 4 cultivator teeth, respectively. These push cultivator teeth can be arranged in many different locations on the Wheel Hoe tool bar. You can use the standard configurations seen in our product photos, or you can customize a configuration to work for your specific crop spacing. Recently we planted several rows of Asian greens in our high-tunnel growing house. And while the greens were growing well, so were the weeds. We needed a way to weed these Asian greens that were planted on a very close row spacing.</p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11355\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/single-push-cultivator.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-11355 size-medium\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/single-push-cultivator-300x286.jpg\" alt=\"Single Wheel Push Cultivator\" width=\"300\" height=\"286\"></a> Single Wheel Hoe Push Cultivator[/caption]\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Push Cultivator Improvising</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using the Double Wheel Hoe, we were able to determine a setup that would work perfect for weeding these greens. We used two push cultivator teeth and placed one behind each wheel, so that the path of each wheel would also determine our weeding path. This would allow us to straddle a row of these closely planted greens and cultivate each side of the plants in one pass down the row. It worked perfectly. The point and curvature of the cultivator teeth allow them to easily move through the garden soil while uprooting all weeds in the way. See how easily it was done in this video:</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_pufbxtyes\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Spreader Bar Extension opens the door for even more possibilities for Wheel Hoe weeding and cultivating configurations. The <a href=\"/products/spreader-bar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spreader Bar Extension</a> allows you to extend the length of the Wheel Hoe tool bar on either side for more attachment locations for our push cultivator implements. And while the options are endless, some great ideas include adding more cultivator teeth for a wider cultivating/weeding path, extending the bedding width of the <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plow Set</a> attachment, or offsetting the weeding path of attachments such as our <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oscillating Hoes</a> or <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-sweeps-attachment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeps</a>.</p>",

    "body_html": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we were kids, I can remember doing our vegetable garden planting by hand. It was a group effort. My dad would use the handle of a hoe to punch a hole in the dirt and the kids would come behind him and drop seed in the hole.</p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_10945\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/garden-planting1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-10945\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/garden-planting1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Garden Planting Silver Queen Corn\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></a> Garden Planting Silver Queen Corn[/caption]\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mom would then come behind us with her hoe and she would cover and pack the dirt over the seeds. And while we grew many great gardens this way, it's definitely not the most efficient way to plant a vegetable garden. Although dad was pretty good at punching holes in the dirt with his hoe, there was no true way of getting all of those seeds planted at the same depth. And although mom was also pretty good at covering up the seeds, there was no way to ensure all were equally covered.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To obtain a well-germinated, quality stand of any particular crop, it's important to plant all seeds equidistant from one another and to plant all seeds at the same depth. This is why a mechanical <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/seeders/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Garden Seeder</a> is the essential garden planting tool for even the smallest vegetable gardens. Not only will it save you a great amount of time, it will also save a ton of energy and your back! A Garden Seeder allows you to plant all seeds in a row equidistant (for whatever seed spacing you choose) from one another and it allows you to plant all those seeds at the same depth with the same amount of compaction and soil coverage. This consistency in your garden planting can be the difference between a mediocre stand and a remarkable stand of vegetables in your garden.</p>\n<iframe src=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Garden Planting Made Easy!</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For garden planting staples like corn and beans, the versatility of the <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/seeders/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> makes it a \"must-have\" tool! The ability to customize seed spacing and hole size is most important for crops like corn and beans. Corn and beans have by far the most variance in seed size between different varieties than any other crops. Because the seed sizes are different among each variety, you're going to need a different seed plate with a customized seed hole size for each variety. Also, everyone has a different preferred seed spacing for corn and beans. Because we use drip irrigation, we're able to plant our corn much closer together on about 3 1/8\" spacing. However, most people plant on 4\" - 6\" spacing. So there needs to be a simple solution to accommodate all of these requests.</p>\n<iframe src=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our innovative <a href=\"/products/garden-seed-plates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seed Plate</a> design makes this really easy. With a simple drill and a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Neiko%C2%AE-10194A-Shank-Titanium-Increments/dp/B000FZ2UOY/ref=sr_1_1?s=industrial&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459438259&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">step-drill bit</a>, you can easily customize the size of the holes in the seed plates. It's important to drill the holes large enough so that the seed lays comfortably flat in the hole without touching any of the sides of the hole. This will ensure that seeds will feed through the holes easily during garden planting. Seed spacing is also really easy. Simply divide 19\" by the number of holes in the seed plate to calculate seed spacing. To plant seeds closer together, drill more holes in the plate. To plant seeds farther apart, cover up the bottom of existing holes with tape. It doesn't get any easier than that!</p>\n            <div class=\"video-container\">\n              <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5UCIpXFla0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n            </div>\n          ",

Here in <a href=\"http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zone 8b</a>, it can get quite warm later in the growing season. During these periods of high temperatures, it becomes very difficult to provide water to our vegetables plants in the garden. This is amplified when plants such as corn develop a foliage canopy, which makes it even more difficult to deliver water to the roots from an overhead source. This dilemma was the primary impetus for us beginning to use drip irrigation. Once we began using it, however, we discovered so many more benefits!</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Benefits of Drip Irrigation</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Water conservation.</strong> Because you're only delivering water to the roots where the plant can absorb it,  you won't need to use near as much water. You won't be watering leaves and paths between plants anymore, so you'll save on your water and electric bill by watering less and more efficiently.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Fewer Weeds.</strong> Just like our vegetable plants, weeds need water to grow. When you water your garden from overhead, it delivers water between plant rows and allows weeds in those areas to thrive. Using drip tape eliminates watering those areas of your garden, which reduces weed germination and growth.</p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_10492\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/drip-irrigation-22.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-10492\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/drip-irrigation-22-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Drip Irrigation Supplies\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></a> Drip Irrigation Supplies[/caption]\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Less Disease.</strong> Many common plant diseases and fungal infections are caused by excessive moisture on the plant foliage. By reducing the moisture in these areas, you'll have fewer issues with disease and fungi in your vegetable garden. This is especially the case with crops like squash and pumpkin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Fertilize Easier.</strong> <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fertilizer Injectors</a> are a wonderful tool that allow you to provide important nutrients to your plants while you water. A drip irrigation system amplifies the benefits of a fertilizer injector because it delivers those plant nutrients exactly where they need it. You'll conserve fertilizer and have healthier looking plants as a result.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Increased Yields.</strong> Watering and providing nutrients more efficiently will always result in increased yields in your vegetable garden. Due to the ease of watering with drip irrigation, you won't ever have to worry about your plants becoming stressed during the growing season. This will allow your vegetable plants to devote all their energy to producing large, flavorful fruits for you to enjoy.</p>\nWhile using drip irrigation does require a small bit of pre-planning with your garden design, it is well worth it once your vegetable garden is planted. Take the time and devote the resources now so you can reap the rewards in the future.\n\n ",

We'll start with the handle styles.</p>\n\n<h2>Styles of Wheel Hoe Handles</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have two different styles of hardwood, ash handles for our <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wheel-hoes/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wheel Hoes</a> -- steam bent and pistol grip. The <a href=\"/products/pistol-grip-handles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pistol grip handles</a> have a wide block at the end that fits in the palm of your hand with your fingers wrapping around like the block like you are gripping a \"pistol.\" This type of handle was the preferred design in the late 1800s and early 1900s when Wheel Hoes were the preferred tool for all farmers -- not just market farmers and backyard gardeners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/steam-bent-wheel-hoe-handles.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-10001\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/steam-bent-wheel-hoe-handles-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"steam-bent-wheel-hoe-handles\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"></a>The <a href=\"/products/steam-bent-handles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">steam bent handles</a> have a curved end that's not as thick as the pistol grip handles. The ends of the steam bent handles are bent and formed by an Amish group in Ohio who uses a very detailed and unique heating and bending process.  In the early 1900s when pistol grips were most popular, the steam bent handles were actually an up-charge option on the Planet Jr. Wheel Hoes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So which is best? Nowadays most people prefer the steam bent handles because it's easier to wrap your hands around them. They're also easier to grip when performing a forward and backward shuffling motion of weeding or cultivating, such as is done with our <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oscillating Hoes</a>. The pistol grip handles work great when the Wheel Hoe is being continuously pushed forward down the row, such as is done when using the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plow</a> attachments. It's really about personal preference. If you're just using it to make furrows and hill with the Plows, the pistol grips might be best for you. If you're going to shuffle the hoe down the row like has traditionally been done, then the steam bent handles are probably best.</p>\n\n<h2>Heights of Wheel Hoe Handles</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We also have two different lengths of handles -- a standard handle (Single and Double Wheel Hoe) and a <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-junior/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Junior Wheel Hoe</a> handle. The Junior Wheel Hoe handles are the same steam bent handles included with the Single and Double Wheel Hoe, except they have 10\" cut off the end. In the location on the Wheel Hoe frame where the handles attach, you will notice that the top bolt hole is slotted. This slotted hole allows you to adjust the handles up or down depending on your height. Simply loosen that nut on each side, move the handles to the desired height and tighten the nut.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the standard wheel hoe handles included with the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> and <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a>, the range of height adjustment is 38\" to 45\" from the ground to the tallest point on the handles. For the Junior Wheel Hoe handles, the range of height adjustment is 33\" to 39\" from the ground to the tallest point on the handles. As with handle style, handle height is also a matter of personal preference. Some people push the Wheel Hoe using more leg strength than arm strength, and so they prefer the handles lower on the hip. However, some people push the Wheel Hoe using their upper body more than their legs, and so they prefer the handles higher above the hip.</p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_10003\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/wheel-hoe-handles-adjustment-low.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-10003\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/wheel-hoe-handles-adjustment-low-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Wheel Hoe Handles - Low Range of Adjustment\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></a> Wheel Hoe Handles - Low Range of Adjustment[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_10005\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/wheel-hoe-handles-adjustment-high.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-10005\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/wheel-hoe-handles-adjustment-high-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Wheel Hoe Handles - High Range of Adjustment\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></a> Wheel Hoe Handles - High Range of Adjustment[/caption]",

Although in black and white, the photos provide great detail for how the tools are intended to be used.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's incredible how a tool like the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wheel Hoes\">Wheel Hoe</a> has stood the test of time and it is equally as useful today as it was 100 years ago. As the this catalog states, \"Few gardens are too small to require a wheel hoe as it will save more than enough time and labor to pay for itself in the first year.\" This couldn't be more true. There's just not another tool that you will find that allows you to do so much in your vegetable garden with little effort. This is also probably why the design has hardly changed at all in over 100 years of it's existence.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Planet Jr Single Wheel Hoe</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/planet-junior-single-wheel-hoe.jpg\"><img height=\"225\" width=\"300\" alt=\"planet-junior-single-wheel-hoe\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/planet-junior-single-wheel-hoe-300x225.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-9649 size-medium\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Planet Jr Single Wheel Hoe</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we started Hoss Tools, we sought to design a Wheel Hoe that was very similar to the time-tested design of the Planet Jr Wheel Hoe. The only significant improvement we made was including oil impregnated bronze bushings into the wheels to improve durability. Our steel parts are also powder coated, but of course powder-coating wasn't available in the early 1900s either.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Planet Junior Single Wheel Hoe was available in several different packages which included the No. 16, No. 17, No. 17 1/2, and No. 18. According to the catalog, \"The No. 16 is the most completely equipped Planet Jr. Single Wheel Hoe. \" When this catalog was published, you could purchase a No. 16 Single Wheel Hoe for a whopping $8.50! And although the value of the dollar has changed quite a bit since 1934, the quality of this <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wheel Hoes\">Wheel Hoe</a> hasn't.</p>",

    "body_html": "[caption id=\"attachment_9260\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/Garden-Seeder-Seed-Plates.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9260 size-medium\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/Garden-Seeder-Seed-Plates-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Garden Seeder Seed Plates\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></a> Garden Seeder Seed Plates[/caption]\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Garden Seeder Seed Plates are just one of the many features on the innovative design of our <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/seeders/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. Our Seed Plates were designed with the customer in mind -- with ease of use and affordability being very important. This design makes our Seed Plates the easiest to customize and the most affordable as compared to all other mechanical garden seeders on the market.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So why is Seed Plate customization for a garden seeder so important? Can't you just have a corn plate that will plant all varieties of corn?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not really. For certain crops like corn, beans, and peas, there are thousands of varieties available to consumers. Each of these varieties will have its own set of unique characteristics which might include yield, disease-resistance, heat-tolerance and most importantly for mechanical planters -- seed size. For instance, we plant a variety of corn called \"Silver Queen\" which has a relatively large kernel as compared to most sweet corn. We also plant a variety of field corn called \"Hickory King\" which has a really large kernel compared to most field corn. There lies the problem. With so much variance in seed size, how do we develop a system that can account for that variance and accurately plant each variety?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Garden Seeder Seed Plates are made of a machinable plastic that can be easily modified to meet your needs. All you need is a drill. We like to use a \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/b?node=256287011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">step drill bit</a>\", but a regular drill bit will work as well. The stock plates included with each Garden Seeder have pre-drilled holes which are on the small size spectrum as far as seed size goes. This is because you can always make a hole larger, but you can't make it smaller! A general rule of thumb is to have the diameter of the hole 1.25 - 1.5 times the diameter of the seed you are planting. This will ensure that all seeds can pass through the seed plate holes, but two seeds cannot get stuck and jam a single hole.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Test Your Garden Seeder Seed Plates!</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, this means that you will have to do a little bit of pre-planning before you plant. It doesn't take very long and will always beat the heck out of planting by hand! Once you have the Garden Seeder Seed Plates correctly modified for a particular variety, the plate should be true to that variety year after year. If you plant multiple varieties of corn, beans or peas, we suggest having a plate for each variety. You can modify one of our pre-drilled seed plates or customize one of our blank seed plates. The great thing is that our <a href=\"/products/garden-seed-plates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seed Plates</a> are only $5.99 each, unlike some of our competitors whose extra plates are $20 - $40!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So always test your Seed Plates with your seed before planting. Modify if necessary, and always keep plenty of extra plates on hand!</p>\n ",

These types of GMO posts are all over the web and are generally of this variety -- extremely misleading and confusing. Allow me to explain.</p>\n<h2>What is a GMO?</h2>\n<p>The term \"GMO\", which stands for genetically-modified organism, was originally coined to describe transgenic crop varieties. Transgenic varieties are genetically engineered by inserting a gene from an unrelated organism (usually bacteria) into the DNA of a plant species. The added gene gives the plant a certain characteristic that it would not otherwise have. Usually the characteristic is a resistance to a particular herbicide or disease. In the case of GMO-cotton, the plant is resistant to glyphosate (Roundup). This allows the grower to eliminate all weeds without damaging the cotton in the growing fields.</p>\n<p>In the post above, corn is the only crop in which a true-GMO or transgenic variety has been developed. The other crops (banana, carrot, eggplant, watermelon) in the photo have changed over time through selective breeding and hybridization. This process involves taking two individuals of the same species and breeding them so that the offspring has desirable traits of both parent plants. So yes, they all have been \"genetically modified\" to some extent -- but the processes are completely different. Inserting an unrelated gene into a plant is quite different than breeding two plants of the same species.</p>\n<p>This photo is a perfect example of the plethora of misinformation you can find all over the internet regarding GMO and non-GMO food. We're not here to promote or condemn GMO or non-GMO. But it is important that people are appropriately informed so they can make an educated decision for themselves and their family.</p>\n<p>We believe that the only way to truly know what's in your food is to grow it yourself!</p>",

Below are several reasons why you should do this too!</p>\n<h2>Why Make a Garden Plan?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>It will give you an idea how much seed you will need. You will then know how much of each seed to purchase so you don't waste money by buying extra seed that you won't use.</li>\n<li>It will help you decide which irrigation supplies you will need for watering your garden. Since we use drip irrigation, the garden plan provides information as to how much drip tape we will need for the spring season.</li>\n<li>It will give you an idea of how much food you are going to get from your garden. This allows you to prepare and make room in your freezer(s) and pantries for the food you will preserve.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what things should you consider when planning your vegetable garden?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think about how much food you need for you and your family, and of course a little extra to give to friends.</li>\n<li>Think about how much food you need in the freezer or pantry to feed your family during the winter when the garden isn't producing warm season crops.</li>\n<li>Think about which crops need to be harvested nearly every day (squash, tomatoes, cucumbers), which crops are harvested several times a season (peas, beans), and which crops will be a one-time harvest (corn, potatoes).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is the garden plan for our smaller, appropriately named Hoss Jr. Garden. For this particular garden, there are several crops we are not going to grow this spring because we have plenty in the freezer from last year. These crops include bush beans, butterbeans and okra.

Pelleted seeds are becoming increasingly more popular and more seed companies are developing pelleted versions of carrot, lettuce, beet and chard seed. Mechanical planters are not able to plant the raw versions of these seed types because the seeds are not uniform in shape. So the seed companies coat the seeds with an inert clay to make the seed round and uniform. Seed companies are now developing organic and hybrid versions of pelleted seeds. Once the seeds are made round, they will now accurately feed through a mechanical planter system.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pelleted Carrot Seed for Everyone!</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/pelleted-carrot-seed-3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8704\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/pelleted-carrot-seed-3-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Pelleted Carrot Seed\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Early Carrot Harvest</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pelleted seeds are great for everyone because they allow gardeners and farmers to plant more efficiently, precisely and accurately using a <a title=\"Garden Seeders\" href=\"/collections/garden-seeders\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Seeder</a> as opposed to planting by hand.

This Seed Plate design makes our Seeders the most versatile on the market because of the ability to customize the Seed Plates to match your seed size and your desired seed spacing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although they have the above similarities, there are also distinct differences between the Hoss Garden Seeder and the Wheel Hoe Seeder Attachment. The Wheel Hoe Seeder Attachment is designed to attach to our <a href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" title=\"Wheel Hoes\" target=\"_blank\">Wheel Hoes</a>, while the Hoss Garden Seeder is a stand-alone unit that is strictly for garden planting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another primary difference between the two Garden Seeders is the furrow openers that open a space in the soil for the dropped seed. The Seeder Attachment has a furrow opener that consists of a solid plate of metal called a \"shoe.\" This shoe-style furrow opener works great for planting in a firm, clean seed bed. It doesn't perform well in situations where there are high levels of undecomposed organic matter in the soil. On the contrast, the Hoss Garden Seeder has a rolling coulter or double disk furrow opener that rolls along the soil, opening a furrow for dropping seed. The rolling coulter furrow opener on the Hoss Garden Seeder is more forgiving in a wide variety of planting situations, including high levels of organic residue.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The final difference is that the Wheel Hoe Seeder Attachment has a short, wide rear packing wheel while the Hoss Garden Seeder has our 15\" steel wheel. The wide rear packing wheel on the Wheel Hoe Seeder Attachment performs well on a firm seed bed. If you have really fluffy soil or you till your garden before you plant, we recommend using the Hoss Garden Seeder.</p>\nWhile the Seeder Attachment has been one of our most popular products for several years now, we designed the Garden Seeder to be more versatile in certain growing situations.  Click on the graphic below to see a flow chart that will guide you to decide which Seeder will work best in your garden.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/Seeder-Choice-Flow-Chart.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6184\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/Seeder-Choice-Flow-Chart-1024x719.jpg\" alt=\"Seeder-Choice-Flow-Chart\" width=\"576\" height=\"404\"></a></p>",

We've taken our innovative <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/seed-plates\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seed Plates\">Seed Plate</a> design used with our <a href=\"/collections/garden-seeders\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Garden Seeder Attachments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seeder Attachment</a> and implemented it on a stand-alone Garden Seeder unit. As with our other products, the handles are Amish-crafted hardwood and the frame is made of powder coated steel.</p>\nHere are some of the new features on the Hoss Garden Seeder:<br><br>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1) \"Rolling Coulter\" Furrow Opener - This design was used because we have many customers who cover crop year round, and thus have a lot of organic residue in their soils. The double disk design in front of the seed drop tube rolls through any organic debris, making it easy to plant in clean or heavy-cover soils. The rolling coulter furrow opener also allows you to plant in freshly tilled soils. While the Seeder Attachment prefers a firm seed bed, the Hoss Garden Seeder can be used in those fluffier soils. This is a great benefit for those \"weekend warrior\" types who like to till and plant on the same day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) Kickstand - The kickstand allows the Hoss Garden Seeder to stand on its own when not in use. When in use, the kickstand simply follows behind the rear wheel of the Garden Seeder. It only touches the soil on the outside of the wheel, so it does not disrupt any planted seed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) Depth Adjustment Knob - Planting depth can be easily adjusted by turning the knob on the front of the Garden Seeder Frame. Each side of the frame has a depth gauge that has tick marks for changing planting depth in 1/4\" increments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Hoss Garden Seeder is simple, versatile and tough! The rolling coulter design allows you to plant in a wide variety of soil and cover crop situations, and our innovative Seed Plate design allows you to customize planting to meet your exact needs.</p>",

We received the onions in the mail a couple of weeks ago and were ready to plant! We ordered one bunch of the Southern Belle Red variety and a Short-Day Sampler bunch that included Texas White, Yellow Granex, and Southern Belle Red varieties. Based on our geographical location here in south Georgia, we must plant the \"short-day\" onion varieties. Because of our warm climate, we typically like to plant onions in November and harvest in early spring before we plant our warm-season crops. We are running a little behind this year, but it should be fine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We went to the nearby dairy and picked up a load of manure to spread in the bed for our onion planting. We always like to amend our soils with compost at least once a growing season. Good compost or manure can alleviate many common garden problems such as diseases and fertilization issues in the future. We added the manure and worked it in with the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\">Hoss Double Wheel Hoe</a>. We then used the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/products/row-maker/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Row Maker\">Row Maker</a> to make four rows for planting our onion transplants.

    "body_html": "The Hoss Garden is in full swing and the tomatoes are coming in strong. A couple of years ago, we installed a small greenhouse to grow our own plants. I wanted to try new varieties of tomatoes and other peppers. I had only planted Amelia's the last few years, because that's all I could get. Last year, I trialed the following varieties: Mt. Glory, Talladega, Bella Rosa, Fletcher and a few heirloom (just for the fun of it). I can only grow Spotted Wilt Virus Resistant Tomatoes for the most part. I always try to grow a few heirlooms and a couple generally make it. While all the F1 Hybrids did fairly well, Bella Rosa was my favorite, and that's the only Round Hybrid I grew this year. It's a nice large uniform fruit with very little cracking. It has large yields and it tastes great! Next year, I want to try <a href=\"http://www.tasti-lee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tasti-Lee</a>, a new one developed by the University of Florida.\n<h2>Drip Irrigation in the Hoss Garden</h2>\nI use no commercial fertilizer. I apply a large amount of cow manure compost a month before planting. I plant all of my garden on Drip Tape, no plastic mulch, just drip tape. We use the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hoss Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the furrow attachments to install the tape about 4\" to 6\" deep. I plant right next to the tape. In the past, I had a lot of blossom end rot, but haven't had that problem in the last two years. We have all heard that calcium deficiency  and improper watering causes this. My soil samples have always showed a high calcium level. However I believe the calcium was unavailable. The combination of large amount of good compost and drip irrigation works for us the Hoss Garden. Very little insect and disease pressure makes growing tomatoes one of my favorite things to grow.\n\nTo see pictures of the Hoss Garden, like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Hoss-Tools-342009687270/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> and check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZnfO4fIz4ThYKHwB7t4NWw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube channel</a>. We'd love to see your pictures too!\n\nHappy Gardening,\nGreg",

I have always been interested in how people in different cultures raise, sell, cook and eat their food. I thought, “This is great because this is where the locals shop.” We wandered around, unable to communicate with anyone with the language barrier. I was amazed at the presentation and cleanliness of the way they marketed their produce. It wasn’t a dusty, dirty kind of open-air market!</p>\n<p>I spotted something I had never seen before. It was a variety of pumpkin called Musquee De Provence. A little research when we got home revealed that in the US this variety is sometimes called Fairytale Pumpkin. A deep ribbed and sort of flat pumpkin with a dull red outside caught my eye.</p>\n<p>But it was the inside that blew me away. A thick, deep-red flesh inside tempted you to just pick it up and eat it like an apple. They cut it in quarters and sell it that way. It’s a Southern France mainstay and great for cooking. They average 8-15lbs. and store well. Seeds are available from <a href=\"www.rareseeds.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"www.rareseeds.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RareSeeds</a> and <a href=\"www.johnnyseeds.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Johnny Seeds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JohnnySeeds</a>.</p>\n<p>I have ordered mine and they will have a home in the Hoss Garden this year.</p>\n<p><img title=\"The Fairytale Pumpkin\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Fairytale-Pumpkin-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></p>",

They teach you how to garden, or even market farm, on a small plot of land - less than an acre.

The methods of Spin Farming effectively eliminate both of those obstacles. There is little real-world help for gardeners who would like to earn an income by doing what we love to do. Spin Farming provides that assistance.</p>\n<p>After meeting Lee, talking to the lady from Alabama, and taking a closer look at the Spin Farming site, I wanted to know more, so I emailed Roxanne Christensen who operates <a title=\"Somerton Tanks Farm\" href=\"http://www.somertontanksfarm.org/\">Somerton Tanks Farm</a> using the Spin Farming method. Roxanne has managed to gross as much as $68,000 on just 20,000 square feet of land.</p>\n<p>Operations like Roxanne’s show that there is an amazing opportunity out there for small farmers.

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:43:22-04:00",
    "body_html": "<p>If you've never heard of vine okra, you need to hear this story. Back in August of last year a friend and I were on our way to Holmes County, Ohio, to visit with some Amish customers. We decided to stop in Jamestown, Tennessee, to spend the night with my friend’s Grandmother. I had heard about this region from my friend and was anxious to see the lay of the land and meet the mountain people I had heard about. Jamestown, the county seat of Fentress County, is located on the Cumberland Plateau, and sits in the eastern-most section of Middle Tennessee. Mrs. Lu, as we called her, lived in the county, a few miles from town on a small winding road in an old farmhouse. We arrived late in the afternoon, and I immediately noticed the garden growing next to the house. Being a garden nut, I wandered over to take a gander at it. The first thing I noticed was that this was not a fad or something these people were trying for the first time. This garden was there for one reason -- to produce food! There were no raised beds, fancy fences or China-made gazing balls. You could tell the object here was to have the maximum amount of output with the least amount of cost. Rows of pole beans were growing on tripod trellises. The trellises consisted of whatever wood could be found in the nearby hardwood bottoms. The pole beans were an old, large flat variety that I had not seen in years. I remembered them from when I was a boy and people grew them for the fresh market. I noticed tomatoes and other vegetables growing in the back of the garden. I could not enjoy the rest of it, for admiring the pole beans. Being about eight feet tall, they had to have a ladder to harvest them. You could tell it was a main staple of their diet. They canned them outside under a large tree and depended on them for the winter. Mrs. Lu, knowing we were coming, had prepared a large dinner for us. As we walked into the kitchen I was reminded of my grandmother’s kitchen. It was small, and there weren’t many cabinets. Only the essentials had a place here. We sat down at the small table and passed the bowls back and forth to fill our plates. After I got a generous portion of pole beans, I noticed a plate of fried okra. I do love fried okra and probably got more than my share. When I tasted the okra I thought it was good, but different than I what I was used to. When Mrs. Lu came back in to refill our glasses with sweet tea, I commented on how great the food was and questioned her as to the variety of okra. She said that was vine okra. I had always grown Clemson Spineless and was familiar with a few other heirloom varieties, but I had never heard of vine okra. Being something of a self-pronounced expert on vegetable gardening, I figured she had gotten confused or misunderstood the correct variety. I did, however, know that it was good and different and I had to know what it was. I asked if, after dinner, she would show me the plants growing in the garden. She showed me a few plants growing on a tripod trellis similar to the pole beans. It was full of yellow flowers and, yes, it was a vine. I had grown some Loofah sponge before and knew this plant resembled it.</p>\n<h2>Where to Find Vine Okra?</h2>\nAfter returning home I Googled \"vine okra\" and found it to actually be an edible gourd: Luffa acutangula. Common name: Vine Okra. Mrs. Lu was right after all. I found seeds at <a href=\"http://rareseeds.com/bonanza-141.html\">Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds</a>, and I grew vine okra in my garden this year. I think it will have a place for years to come.",

Beginning in the late 1870s, the firm has focused on the recreational gardeners as well as one-horse farmers, thriving as suburbanization gathered force, but ensued later by serving a large group of farmers. During that time, they somehow failed at getting the attention of government researchers to allow themselves to introduce their tools in a wide realm of agriculture.   For the better part of its history, the Planet Jr Cultivator firm highlighted its push wheel hoes and automatic seed drills, devices set with all sort of gadgets and practically hard to describe at that time. During then, wheel hoes turn up with one wheel or two: single wheel gear normally ran between rows of foliage and cut off or ripped up weeds on either side.</p>\n<p><img height=\"255\" width=\"314\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/planet-jr-cultivator.jpg\" title=\"planet-jr-cultivator\">  </p>\n<p>In 1930, the firm has finally completed its project resolving the horseless one-horse farmers. They made the garden tractor which has significantly reduced all needs for horse-powered tools used for land cultivation and also abolished the need for pushed tools as well. The garden tractor, powered by gasoline, had two metal wheels and snapped iron add-ons when it crashed into buried rocks on the ground. It was not until the 1930’s when they felt the need to compete and developed farming tools for the three groups of users: large-scale cultivators, pleasure gardeners, and small-scale farmers. Government researchers have backed the developing firm and gave emphasis on the advantages of wheel hoes on land cultivation. They broke out into an agricultural sphere not just of one-horse cultivators but also of no-horse farmers, half-horse farmers and wheel hoe farmers. They studied the works of the inventors beyond the notice of trade name agricultural science and technology.

    "body_html": "<p>As the spring/summer growing season is coming to an end, we are preparing and planning for our fall garden.  Specifically we're doing Blackeye Pea bed preparation for the fall. Our goal is always to grow food throughout the year in all seasons when possible.  For this to be accomplished, one must plan ahead of time and keep the garden in workable shape at all times.  We are currently in the process of pulling up spring/summer crops and preparing areas for fall planting, and I wanted to share with you how we use the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\" href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wheel Hoes\">Hoss Wheel Hoe</a> to do this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_6144.jpg\"><img height=\"300\" width=\"200\" alt=\"IMG_6144\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_6144-200x300.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>In this garden, I had Yellow Crookneck Squash planted in between our Fordhook Lima Beans (left) and Rainbow Chard (right).  Over the course of the warm growing season, I was able to keep the weeds in check reasonably well.  However, due to quite a bit of rain in the last few weeks, the weeds became quite thick among the squash plants.  Once I pulled up the squash, there was a wide expanse of weeds that needed to be removed.</p>\n<p>I attached the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\" href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe?variant=45579304960310\" target=\"_blank\" title='12\" Oscillating Hoe'>12\" Oscillating Hoe</a> Attachment to my Hoss <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and started working through the weed patch for the Blackeye Pea bed preparation.  This attachment works like a dream for this type of task as the sharpened spring steel blade cuts through the thickest of weeds. The 12\" Oscillating Hoe Attachment also provides a thorough shallow cultivation on the soil, preparing it for the next planting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/second-pass.png\"><img height=\"300\" width=\"248\" alt=\"second pass\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/second-pass-248x300.png\"></a></p>\n<p>After making one pass through the plot with the Double Wheel Hoe and <a shape=\"rect\" href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001bhEIdgqZRihNhR5zA6MtwfJyTd5XN0WJgo0_zEYep46gY6YX-fIExHV7X2dV9kq9-SyOkcy-J5e7pdH-68WE_ZQ6bjgWLZ-3PcEJmJejpCdWe1_khFqlx4J-R6zXNv9KqHmkxwQd0bYMyylQ4bj2aQ==\" target=\"_blank\">12\" Oscillating Hoe</a>, I used a fan rake to pull all of the cut weeds to the ends of the garden.  The plot looked considerably better after the initial run through it.  However, due to the density of weeds, especially the grassy ones, I needed to make a final quick run to get all of the weeds out of this area.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/finished.png\"><img height=\"199\" width=\"300\" alt=\"finished\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/finished-300x199.png\"></a></p>\n<p>After the second weed-cutting run through the plot, I used the fan rake again to rake the weeds out of the area.  The plot was now free of weeds, cultivated and in great condition for planting soon.  The 12\" Oscillating Hoe did a great job of cutting underneath the thick weeds, while also cultivating the area at the same time.  Below is a link to the video of the Blackeye Pea bed preparation process from start to finish.</p>\n<iframe height=\"315\" width=\"560\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1b6Cd6e9HnU\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

One of them was criticizing the Wheel Hoe as an outdated piece of equipment that was \"too much work,\" while the other was explaining the benefits of using a Wheel Hoe in their garden.  While using personal experience for support, the Wheel Hoe proponent also posted a wheel hoe review which included couple of paragraphs directly quoted from a book published in 1917 titled \"Around the Year in the Garden\" by Frederick Frye Rockwell.  When I read these quotes, I knew I had to find this book!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I did some rigorous online searching and found only two original copies of the book, and purchased both.  The photo above is one of the copies and the other has a blue cover with the same cover artwork.  The book is written in a diary format and details the author's year around his garden and farm.  He describes every process from preparation, planting, harvesting, and what to do during those dreary winter months.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img height=\"300\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-07-09 at 4 26 48 PM\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-09-at-4-26-48-PM-185x300.png\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4187\"></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The photo above from the book shows a <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hoss Double Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> being used with <a href=\"/products/plow-set\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Plow Set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plow</a> attachments to create a furrow for planting potatoes.  Once potatoes are planted, the Plow attachments can be turned outward and the Double Wheel Hoe will cover and hill the planted potatoes.  When speaking about what tools a gardener should have, he says:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">\"Even the smallest gardens should have a wheel hoe in its tool outfit ... As it is a machine that you will probably use in the garden more than all your other tools put together, be sure to get one capable of doing all the work you may have to give it.\"</p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We couldn't agree more with this wheel hoe review more! The Wheel Hoe is just as useful today as it was 100 years ago.  And with all the <a href=\"/collections/wheel-hoes?filter.v.price.gte=&amp;filter.v.price.lte=&amp;filter.p.tag=Attachments&amp;sort_by=best-selling\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wheel Hoe Attachments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Attachments</a> that we have available, you can be sure that it will cover all of your gardening needs from cultivating, furrowing, planting, hilling and weeding. Rockwell goes on to talk about using a <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> versus a <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Single Wheel Hoe</a>.  This is a frequent question we receive from people wondering which Wheel Hoe suits them best.  Rockwell explains it perfectly:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">\"The double-wheel hoe has a distinct advantage over the single-wheel in that the rows can be straddled, permitting very close work while the plants are small and accordingly cutting down the laborious task of hand weeding.  If your garden is at all large the amount of time you will save in weeding it the first time with a double-wheel hoe instead of with a single wheel hoe will make  you satisfied with the slight additional investment.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img height=\"234\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-07-09 at 4 11 18 PM\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-07-09-at-4-11-18-PM-300x234.png\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4189\"></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He then talks about maybe the most important attachment of all, the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seeder</a> or \"seed drill\" (pictured above) as he calls it.  In a complete paragraph, he insists:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">\"By all means get a wheel hoe with a seed-drill combination.  Life is too short, garden space is too valuable, the work of thinning plants and cultivating uneven rows is too costly, to justify anyone's planting a garden by hand.  When you can mark the row, open the furrow, drop the seed, cover it, roll it, and get it straight, in one operation, as fast as you can walk, the laborious task of hand-sowing seeds like onions, carrots, beets or turnips is out of the question.  In addition to doing the job better and infinitely faster, covering all the seeds with fresh earth and dropping them at uniform depth, the seed drill leaves the row neatly rolled on top, so that you can see where to cultivate before the plants are up.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We couldn't have said it better ourselves.  The Seeder attachment for the Wheel Hoe will perhaps save you more time than any other attachment because it is able to perform so many operations in one pass of walking down the row.  As evidenced by the wheel hoe review in this book and our continued use, the Wheel Hoe is a time tested piece of equipment that is a must-have item for everybody from the small backyard gardener to the market farmer.  With the Seeder and other attachments you can prepare, plant, weed and maintain your garden with the Hoss Wheel Hoe.  Our Wheel Hoe is MADE IN THE USA and built to last.  Here's to 100 more years of Wheel Hoe gardening!</p>",

    "body_html": "<p>The <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder\" title=\"Hoss Garden Seeder\" target=\"_blank\">Hoss Seeder</a> is the best solution to all your planting needs.  The versatility and simplicity of the Hoss Seeder makes it superior to the competition.  Our Seeder uses a fixed gear ratio-seed plate design, which means you don't have to worry with changing gear ratios to change planting patterns.  Additionally, our seed plates lay horizontally instead of vertically which improves the ability of the seed plate to pick up a single seed at a time.  Finally, our seeder is more durable as it is made of powder coated steel and not aluminum.  The Hoss Seeder works as an attachment to our Hoss Wheel Hoes and can be used with either the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe\" title=\"Single Wheel Hoe\" target=\"_blank\">Single</a> or <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe\" title=\"Double Wheel Hoe\" target=\"_blank\">Double Wheel Hoe</a>.</p>\n<p><img height=\"270\" width=\"385\" alt=\"Hosstools.com The Big Deal\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/Hoss-Seeder.jpg\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1817 aligncenter\"></p>\n<p>The Hoss Seeder features an easily adjustable planting depth control on the front where planting depth may be adjusted every 1/4 inch. Once a seed is delivered via the seed plate through the seed tube into the ground, the drag chain covers up the seed and the back wheel of the seeder serves to compact the ground behind the covered seed. The width of the back wheel makes our seeder much more stable than the competition, and much easier to push in a straight line. The hopper (pictured below) of the Hoss Seeder holds the seed plate and the brushes with a wing nut.  This simple design makes it easy to change out seed plates, simply by removing the wing nut and brush.   As the back wheel of the seeder turns, the seed plate turns while the brush ensures that only one seed is placed in each hole.  Then as the seed plate moves over the hole in the hopper, the seed drops through the seed plate and into the seed tube for planting.</p>\n<div align=\"justify\"><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/hopper1.png\"><img height=\"225\" width=\"300\" alt=\"hopper\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/hopper1-300x225.png\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-3237 aligncenter\"></a></div>\n<div align=\"justify\">We carry 10 pre-drilled <a href=\"/products/seed-plates\" title=\"Seed Plates\" target=\"_blank\">Seed Plates</a> for use in the Hoss Seeder, designed to plant the smallest to the largest seeds.  These 10 pre-drilled Seed Plates are designed to plant the following seeds:<br><br>\n</div>\n<div align=\"justify\"></div>\n<div>#1 - Broccoli, Cauliflower, Cabbage, Turnips, Mustard, Rutabaga, and other fine seeds</div>\n<div>#2 - Carrots and Lettuce</div>\n<div>#3 - Okra, Beets and Chard</div>\n<div>#4 - Sweet Corn and Popcorn</div>\n<div>#5 - Small Peas and Beans</div>\n<div>#6 - Field Corn and Medium Beans and Peas</div>\n<div>#7 - Radish, Leek, Asparagus, Spinach and other medium seeds</div>\n<div>#8 -  Cucumber and Watermelon</div>\n<div>#9 - Butterbeans, Lima Beans, and other large beans</div>\n<div>#10 - Squash and Pumpkin<br><br>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<p>Seed Plates #1-6 are included with every Hoss Seeder purchase, and Seed Plates #7-10 are available for individual purchase, or as a package deal.</p>\n<div align=\"justify\"><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/seed-plates.png\"><img height=\"225\" width=\"300\" alt=\"seed plates\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/seed-plates-300x225.png\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3244\"></a></div>\n<div align=\"justify\">In some cases, you may wish to use a different seed spacing than what the Hoss Tools pre-drilled Seed Plates are designed to plant.  For every full rotation of the back wheel, the seed plate in the hopper will turn a full rotation as well, and the seeder will have traveled 19\" in this time.  Therefore, if you divide 19\" by the number of holes in a given seed plate, this will provide you with the seed spacing distance.  For instance, Seed Plate #6 for field corn has four holes, which means that this particular seed plate will plant a seed every 4 3/4 inches.<br><br>\n</div>\n<div align=\"justify\"></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"></div>\nA simple solution to increasing spacing between plants is to place tape over some of the holes on a seed plate.  Simply place a piece of Scotch tape on the bottom side of the seed plate over the holes you wish to cover.  Make sure that you cover an even number of holes and that the holes covered are opposite one another on the seed plate.  Using the above example with Seed Plate #6, if two of the four holes were covered, the seed plate would now plant field corn with 9 1/2\" spacing between seeds.<br><br>\n<div align=\"justify\">\n<img height=\"225\" width=\"300\" alt=\"customizable seed plates\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/customizable-seed-plates-300x225.png\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3246\"><br><br>\n</div>\n<div align=\"justify\">Another solution to seed plate customization is our Customizable Seed Plates and Metal Drill Template (above).  We offer blank seed plates in three different thicknesses, 3/32\", 3/16\", and 1/4\", for customizing seed plates for a variety of seed shapes and sizes.  The Metal Drill Template is very useful in marking holes for drilling into the Customizable Seed Plates, ensuring that hole spacing is equal between all holes.<br><br>\n</div>\n<div align=\"justify\"></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"></div>\nThe simple, yet effective design along with the seed plate customization make the Hoss Seeder the most versatile and BEST garden seeder on the market!",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:43:13-04:00",
    "body_html": "<p>We absolutely love tomatoes and we love to grow an abundance of them every year.  We eat them fresh off the vine on a tomato sandwich and we preserve them in many different ways including salsa, spaghetti sauce, chili sauce, and homemade ketchup.  While growing, tomatoes, plants must be trellised in some way to keep the plants and that delicious fruit off the ground, away from pests and fungus. Depending on how many tomatoes you plan on growing, the time you have, and the money you are willing to spend, there are many different ways that tomato trellising can be done to keep plants off the ground.</p>\n<h2><strong>Florida Weave</strong></h2>\n<p>The Florida Weave is an old staking and stringing technique that works well if you are growing a whole row or rows of tomatoes.  This is the technique we prefer as we typically grow at least one long, 100+ ft. row.  We use metal stakes on the end and throughout the row and use <a title=\"Cotton Butchers String\" href=\"/products/cotton-butchers-twine/\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton</a><a title=\"Cotton Butcher Twine\" href=\"/products/cotton-butcher-twine\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"/products/cotton-butcher-twine\"> Butchers</a><a title=\"Cotton Butchers String\" href=\"/products/cotton-butchers-twine/\" target=\"_blank\"> String</a> or <a title=\"Gro-Tie Garden Twine\" href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine\" data-mce-href=\"/products/gro-tie-garden-twine\" target=\"_blank\">Gro-Tie Twine</a> to do the stringing.  Weave the string in a figure 8 on both sides of the plants from row end to row end, wrapping around each stake in the row.  As the plants grow, simply weave another line of string higher on the stakes to support the plants.  This technique is relatively inexpensive assuming everyone has some metal stakes or old fence posts laying around and all you have to purchase is the twine or string.  However, this technique can be more time consuming than others as string must be added as plants grow.</p>\n<p><br><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/florida_weave.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-3056 aligncenter\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/florida_weave.png\" alt=\"florida_weave\" width=\"547\" height=\"410\"></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Tomato Cages</strong></h2>\n<p>Tomato cages are ideal for those people who grow just a few tomato plants and have less time on their hands.  This is also a good solution for people who have limited gardening space.  Quality tomato cages are more expensive than a box of string, but they are also durable, re-usable, and fold up for easy storage in the off-season.  Our Tomato Cages are made of heavy, 9 gauge wire, have large 8\" square openings for harvesting, and are available in 40\" or 58\" tall versions.  These cages are much more durable than the flimsy, cone-shaped supports that can be found at your local big box store.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/tomato-cage-20012.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1809\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/tomato-cage-20012.jpg\" alt=\"tomato-cage-\" width=\"429\" height=\"301\"></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Panel Trellis</strong></h2>\n<p>A panel trellis is a good solution for those people who have more than a few plants, but do not necessarily plant a whole row of tomatoes.  As with the tomato cages, the panel trellis technique can be more expensive than simply buying a roll of string, but it requires less time and panels are re-usable one growing season to the next.  There are a variety of different panels one could use for this technique, from a galvanized livestock fence panel to a cut piece of fencing.  Our Pea Trellis provides a heavy duty solution as it is made of heavy, 9 gauge wire, has large openings for harvesting, and folds up nicely for compact storage in the off-season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/10400PF-800x591-21.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1814 alignnone\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/10400PF-800x591-21.jpg\" alt=\"Hoss Pea Fence\" width=\"555\" height=\"389\"></a> Depending on the amount of tomatoes you plan on growing, the time you have to take care of them, and the amount of money you are willing to spend, we are confident that one of these solutions will help keep your tomatoes off the ground and your produce abundant.  Here's to a great tomato crop for everyone this spring/summer growing season!</p>",

Plant them in rows in your spring/summer garden and they will attract pollinators for your crops and provide beauty to your garden all growing season long.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<strong>Use organic pesticides.</strong> If you use pesticides in your garden, make sure it is organically sourced. Pesticides containing neonicotinoids and other harmful chemicals can have detrimental effects on bee behavior and fertility. One known harmful effect of non-organic pesticides on bees is Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) which results in the death of adult bees and eventual demise of the colony.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<strong>Have a clean water source nearby.</strong> Bees use water for cooling the hive through evaporation and for thinning honey to feed to larva. We use a bucket with clean water with a little pine straw in it. The pine straw provides the bees a solid footing during water consumption.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<strong>Plant a flowering cover crop.</strong> Crimson clover is a short-lived perennial that can be planted in late summer or early spring. It works great for attracting bees and fixing nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility.</li>\n</ol>",

    "body_html": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although we love the taste, texture and beauty of heirloom tomatoes, we unfortunately are lucky if 1 out of every 10 plants makes any tomatoes each year.  Therefore we have settled to the point where we are happy if we simply get enough heirlooms for a couple of tomato and mayonnaise sandwiches.  Our ultimate enemy in the heirloom tomato battle is the tomato spotted wilt virus (tospovirus), which is spread by thrips.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ever since the late 80s we cannot grow the old tomato varieties. The tomato spotted wilt virus is a very aggravating one.  After carefully tending to the tomatoes day after day, I would walk out to the garden one day and they would all be wilted. They looked like they just needed water, but it was all over at that point.  There is no cure for the virus and once a plant is infected, you might as well pull it up. Much research was done when the problem first arose, but the initial virus resistant varieties were lacking in flavor.  As a result, many gardeners were still attempting to grow the heirlooms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After giving up on tomatoes for a while, we started experimenting with the virus resistant ones a couple of years ago.  We tried Amelia, Fletcher, Bella Rosa, Mountain Glory and Talladega varieties.  Amelia was very virus resistant, but the flavor was not up to par in my opinion.  The other four all performed well and had great taste.  This year we will grow Bella Rosa (see photo) and a new variety called <a href=\"www.tasti-lee.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"www.tasti-lee.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tasti-Lee</a>.  The Tasti-Lee variety was naturally developed by the University of Florida, and it is a vine-ripened variety that is supposed to bring significant improvements to flavor and health (50% more lycopene).  We are excited about trying this new tomato variety and will share our results this summer.  So if you're having trouble growing tomatoes, try one of the virus resistant varieties.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</p>",
