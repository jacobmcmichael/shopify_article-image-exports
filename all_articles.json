Container gardening can provide flexibility, convenience, and the opportunity to grow plants in areas where traditional gardening is impractical. <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/garden-supplies/root-pouch-grow-bags/\">Root Pouch Grow Bags</a> take this concept to the next level.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So, why choose <a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/garden-supplies/root-pouch-grow-bags/\">Root Pouch Grow Bags</a> for your potato-growing endeavors? The answer lies in their unique design and the benefits they bring to the table. These specialized fabric containers promote optimal root development, enhance aeration and drainage, and offer portability, making them an ideal choice for urban dwellers, renters, or anyone seeking a versatile gardening solution.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<h3><strong>How to Plant Potatoes in Root Pouch Grow Bags</strong></h3>\n<p>To plant potatoes, depending on the size of your container, fill it with 4 to 6 inches of prepared soil and place it in full sun. Your seed potatoes need a good bit of room to grow so be sure and get the correct plant spacing. For example, the <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-15-gallon/\">15 Gallon Root Pouch</a> can comfortably grow 4 potato plants and give the root structure plenty of room for a big harvest. We don’t recommend going smaller than 15 Gallon. The <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-45-gallon/\">45 Gallon Root Pouch</a> can grow 12, and the <a href=\"/products/root-pouch-100-gallon/\">100 Gallon Root Pouch</a> could grow 20-24 potato plants.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"770\" height=\"770\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1.jpg 770w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-600x600.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<h3><strong>Layering</strong></h3>\n<p>The same way that in-ground and raised bed planting requires hilling, container planted potatoes require the same treatment, called layering. To start, put in at least 6 inches of soil, but ideally 10 inches of soil into the bottom of the bag. Seed potatoes should be planted 6 to 12 inches apart and 3 to 6 inches deep. Press your potatoes into the earth as you plant them. Lightly cover your potatoes with 1 to 2 inches of soil. As the plant grows, you will continually add 1 to 2 inches of soil to the top of the plant as it grows to cover the new stems at the bottom until the container is full of soil.</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>Fertilization for</strong> <strong>Potatoes in Root Pouch Grow Bags</strong>\n</h3>\n<p>For a 15 gallon root pouch, fill ¾ with potting soil, add 5 cups of compost or worm castings and 1 cup <a href=\"/products/complete-organic-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hoss Complete Organic fertilizer</a>. Mix together. Then, every 10 days, mix 1 tablet each of <a href=\"/products/dr-joe-all-purpose-growing-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Joe All Purpose</a> and 1 tablet of <a href=\"/products/dr-joe-nutri-bubble-plant-food/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Joe Nutri Bubble</a> into 1 gallon of water. Apply as a drench.</p>\n<h3><strong>Irrigation </strong></h3>\n<p>Root Pouches drain VERY well. They will need watering every 2-3 days, if the weather is very hot, you will need to water every day. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"704\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag.jpg 704w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag-300x176.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potatoes-in-grow-bag-600x352.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<h3><strong>Scratching &amp; Harvesting Potatoes</strong></h3><p>Potatoes can be harvested at different times throughout the growing season based on what you want. Scratching is a term used in gardening, meaning digging up a few of your potatoes before the ten-week maturity date. New potatoes refer to a fresh crop of potatoes that have just recently come out of the ground. You can harvest new potatoes but allow the rest of the plant to keep maturing. Simply dig up the potatoes you want, being very careful not to damage the ones still in the ground, bury the plant again, and water thoroughly. When at least 50% of the tops of the potato vines begin to die off and any flowers have begun to drop off, it’s a good indication that your potatoes are ready to harvest. </p><h3><strong>Curing &amp; Storing Potatoes</strong></h3><p>Much like onions, potatoes need to be cured after being harvested. It helps the skin thicken and let any slight damage heal and prevents bacteria from rotting the potato. Arrange your potatoes in a single layer in a well-ventilated area that is out of direct sunlight for a week to 10 days. Potatoes ideally should be stored around 55ºF and will last in storage for months on end. Warm temperatures will bring the potatoes out of dormancy and cause them to start sprouting. Sunlight will turn the potatoes green and should immediately be discarded. The green color comes from an excess of solamine and if eaten, can cause severe sickness.</p><div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ic8MH71WsIY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  ",

But what happens to your drip tape after you've harvested your crops? Spending the money and time replacing your drip tape is not only costly but wastes hours that could be spent in the garden being productive. So we're going to show you the easiest way to save time and money and simply reuse your drip tape! If you aren't already utilizing drip tape irrigation, here are the main reasons to implement it in your garden.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Benefits Of Drip Irrigation In Your Vegetable Garden</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>Decreases pest and disease pressure naturally by keeping moisture off of the leaves</li>\n<li>Effectively provides the maximum amount of nutrients to the plant for a healthier overall crop</li>\n<li>Conserves water by delivering water and fertilizer directly to the root system, unlike overhead watering</li>\n<li>Cost effective because the drip system can be used in the same plot year after year without needing to replace it</li>\n<li>Aids in weed suppression. With overhead watering, areas of your garden are unnecessarily watered, which results in watering weed seed and germinated weeds that you don’t want to grow</li>\n</ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Step By Step Instructions For Reusing Drip Tape</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<ol>\n<li>Leave the drip tape attached to the <a href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mainline</a> tubing and move the drip tape out of the way. You can use a tool like the <a style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Hoss Double Wheel Hoe</a> with one of our weeding attachments to cultivate and remove any weeds from the area before replanting the next crop.</li>\n<li>Create a furrow using the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a> in the furrowing position to create a row for the drip tape. Lay the drip tape back in the garden with the emitters facing upward.</li>\n<li>Amend the furrow by laying good compost like <a href=\"/products/complete-organic-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hoss Complete Organic</a> down the row evenly and bury the tape using the Double Wheel hoe and switching the plow set to the hilling position. Once the drip tape is buried, we suggest turning the water on and letting the emitters seep out to indicate where to plant your seeds or transplants.</li>\n<li>Plant your seeds or transplants based on the recommended plant spacing and planting depth on the seed packet or the HOSS product page. Cover the seeds with dirt using a hoe or rake.</li>\n</ol><p>One exception is removing the drip tape off of some of the larger rooted crops like corn for example. After harvesting corn, you should cut the stalks down with a while they are still green. If the stalks are still green they dry up quicker and a few weeks later you can pull the drip tape up from the ground without damaging it. Then follow the instructions from the beginning. HOSS demonstrates the process in the video below.</p><div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\"

different spacing requirements, you may find that you need to move your rows. This is actually a very easy process if you have the right tools. If you purchased our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8 Mil Irrigation Kit</a>, or <a href=\"/products/15-mil-drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15 Mil Irrigation Kit</a>, you'll find in your package the it comes with <a href=\"/products/goof-plugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goof Plugs</a> as well as a <a href=\"/products/hole-punch-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hole Punch</a>. These are also available to purchase individually on the website if you need a spare. <br>To move the row, simply disconnect the drip tape from mainline tubing, plug the hole with the Goof Plug, punch a new hole using the Hole Punch, and reconnect the drip tape with the new configuration. Simple as that! </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"gallery-item\">\n\t\t\t\t<a data-elementor-open-lightbox=\"yes\" data-elementor-lightbox-slideshow=\"6c47da9\"

For example, if one season you plant tomatoes, you don’t want to follow it up the next season with tomatoes because the soil will be missing the specific nutrients those tomatoes need because the previous crop has already used those nutrients. Planting cover crops will add those nutrients back into the ground in between plantings. Cover crops make crop rotation less critical and give you more control over your soil. <br>In south Georgia where HOSS is located, we push our soil to the limits in the dead heat of summer. Summer cover crops are our go to solution for keeping our soil healthy between the Spring and Fall planting seasons. And because we don't have to fertilize or put cover crops on drip irrigation, you can save your resources for your cash crops in the main growing seasons.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>The Benefits Of Summer Cover Crops</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>Fixing atmospheric nitrogen and adding it to soils</li>\n<li>Building soils by adding organic matter known as “green manure.”</li>\n<li>Controlling erosion by reducing water runoff and nutrient leaching.</li>\n<li>Suppressing weed growth by providing a dense foliage canopy.</li>\n<li>Managing pests by reducing harmful nematodes and soil fungi.</li>\n<li>Attracting beneficial pollinators.</li>\n</ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Cover Crop Classifications</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p><strong>Monocots</strong> have a tall, upward growth habit similar to corn and have a fibrous root system.  <br><strong>Dicots</strong> tend to grow lower to the ground and have a deep tap root system.<br><strong>Legumes</strong> can be used as a cover crop that can also be harvested and are excellent nitrogen fixers.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Brown Top Millet</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Brown Top Millet is a monocot that works great to prevent soil erosion and suppress weeds. Many people like to use this cover crop as a livestock forage. Others will use it to create feeding plots for doves and other wildlife. Much like Sorghum Sudangrass, it is a taller cover crop and performs very well in the heat. It usually matures in 60 to 70 days.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1016\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2.jpg\" alt=\"Brown Top Millet\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2.jpg 1016w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2-600x403.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pearl-millet-2-768x516.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1016\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sorghum Sudangrass\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1.jpg 1016w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1-600x403.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sorghum-sudangrass-1-768x516.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h2>Sorghum Sudangrass</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Sorghum Sudangrass is monocot that contains a fibrous root system similar to corn. Sorghum Sudangrass will aerate and provide a significant amount of biomass for your soil. This cover crop is taller compared to other warm-season cover crops, and looks much like corn. It also provides a solid ground cover which will outcompete weeds and reduce further weed pressure.

It is the fastest-maturing warm-weather cover crops that we offer. Buckwheat will mature in four to six weeks. This crop is great for attracting pollinators such as bees because they absolutely adore this crop.

Iron Clay Peas have many benefits as a cover crop including nitrogen-fixation, weed suppression, and attracting beneficial insects.

They also have a very deep root system that helps to cycle and scavenge nutrients from the deep. They are also relatively drought-tolerant and perform well in the heat of summer when rainfall may be lower. These are really easy to grow on any scale, whether it be a raised bed or a few acres.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>SuperBee Phacelia</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Super Bee Phacelia is a nitrogen scavenger and has been reported to scavenge up to 15 to 20 units of nitrogen per acre. It has dense foliage which forms a carpet over the soil to retain moisture and prevent erosion. The dense foliage decomposes quickly once cut or tilled and adds carbon and organic matter to soils. Phacelia has also been noted to reduce harmful nematode populations by up to 30%. In milder climates, it can be grown as a fall/winter cover crop because it can withstand temperatures down to 18 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/products/super-bee-phacelia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1016\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia.jpg\" alt=\"Lacy Phacelia\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia.jpg 1016w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia-300x201.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia-600x403.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lacy-phacelia-768x516.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h2>Summer Cover Crop Guide</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Still need help deciding which summer cover crop to use in your garden?

But what happens if you live in an apartment, only have a back porch, or just a small window ledge? Or what if your dedicated garden is already full of rows and rows of vegetables and you just don't have any more room to spare or don't want to add more growing plots, thus creating more work for yourself? The answer is simple - <strong>vertical and container gardening</strong>.\n<h2>The Benefits Of Growing Vegetables In Containers</h2>\nSmall space gardening has become so popular in recent years that the art of growing your own food in containers has been all but perfected. There have been varieties that have been specifically bred to be able to thrive in containers. With that and taking a plant's natural growth habit into account, container gardening is an excellent way to maximize your garden space or utilize whatever space you have available to you.\nAside from maximizing your space, growing food in containers gives you the benefit of protecting your plants during inclement or unexpected weather. If a late Spring freeze comes through, simply bring the containers inside until the threat of frost has passed. \nThe main things to remember when you're choosing container gardening is that it is always important to know <strong>what size container to use (roots need room to grow) and to make sure you have the right soil mix  (nutrients are key)</strong>. \n<h2>What Vegetables Can You Grow In Containers?</h2>\nTomatoes are by and large the most popular vegetable to grow in containers. However, there are so many other vegetables that you can add to the mix and produce plenty of food to harvest. Below are some of our favorite vegetables that will thrive in a container garden.\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- popup content -->\n<!-- badge content -->\n<!-- Thumb content -->\n<a

vegetables using vertical space as opposed to planting in the ground. There are a lot of ways to utilize extra vertical space to grow more food. Regardless of how much extra space you have, be it an extra window, a spare wall, you can maximize your indoor and outdoor space with trellises, hanging gardens, or a wall garden. Below are some DIY vertical gardens that we love. These ideas are just a few of the ways you can use simple materials to make an attractive vertical vegetable or herb garden.\n<h2>Best Vegetables For A Trellis Vertical Garden</h2>\nUsing a plant's natural growth habit is an excellent way to plan on using your extra space to create your vertical garden. Adding a trellis to a spare wall or at the end of your garden plot can increase your food supply greatly. Vegetables that have a climbing or vining growth habit like cucumbers, peppers, and pole beans are the perfect candidates to climb up those places that would otherwise go to waste in an everyday garden.

Preparing for the unexpected like food shortages, rising prices, and supply chain issues will ensure that even in the worst of times, you have what you need to thrive. While a lot of gardeners prefer to eat their crops fresh, preserving either a portion or the entire harvest for long term storage is what we recommend to feel secure in knowing that food insecurity won’t be an issue. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>A Few Things To Consider When Planning On What To Grow In Your Garden\n</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p><b><i>Diversity of the plant</i></b> <br>How many different uses can you get out of one crop? For example, corn can not only be eaten on or off the cob, but can be ground into cornmeal, used as animal feed, or sold at market for extra income.</p><p><b><i>How much space do you have to grow?<br></i></b> While there is a lot of information out there that tells you how much space you need in your garden to feed a person, there are many variables involved like the space requirements for plants, how much each family consumes, just to name a few. This is where planning comes into play. Choose the crops you want to grow, determine the space requirements and the yield for those crops and make sure that you get enough harvest to feed the number of people in your family using the charts, calculators, and planners below. <br><b><i><br>How many people do you plan to feed?<br></i></b>Obviously taking into account the people in your household, you also need to factor in those outside of your family. Are you planning on using these crops in a recipe during a dinner party? Do you plan on giving away some of your preserved food away as gifts to neighbors? If so, you may need to plan on planting some extra crops to account for those factors.</p><p><b><i>Do you have anything left over from last year’s harvest?<br></i></b>Having a bountiful garden is surely a great feeling but not having the space to store the crops you’ve grown is the quickest path to food waste. As a good rule of thumb, it’s a good idea to keep records of everything that you have in the freezer and pantry so that you can have a better idea of what you should be planting. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a data-gallery-index=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h2>How Much To Plant For Your Family</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Because of all the variables that go along with planning your garden, the chart below is simply a recommendation on how much to plant per person on average. Each family consumes different amounts of food, climates, soil, temperatures, etc., change from garden to garden so be sure to adjust these amounts based on your family's needs.

Here in South Georgia (Zone 8B), midsummer gets so hot that there really aren't a lot of vegetables that we can grow that will survive the blistering heat and humidity. So by the time our beans get harvested, we use this opportunity to start planning for our fall garden. This is where <strong>crop rotation</strong> comes into play.\n<h2>What Is Crop Rotation And Why Do We Do It?</h2>\nCrop rotation is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It's the practice of planting and growing different crops in the same garden area in a rotation from year to year.  Some vegetables require more time than others to be away from the soil they first came into contact with. We plant watermelons, for example, on a 5-year rotation but beans are on a steady 3-year rotation in our garden. \n<strong>The 2 main reasons to practice good crop rotation are pest and disease control and soil health</strong>.\nBecause different plants need different nutrients, planting the same crop family in one spot over and over again will ultimately deplete those nutrients and degrade the soil. All plants are vulnerable to specific pests and diseases and those pests usually attack a specific family of vegetables and can stay in the soil waiting for next season's feast but rotating your crops keeps them at bay. \n\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Horn-Worm.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Horn-Worm.jpg 500w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Horn-Worm-300x300.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Horn-Worm-150x150.jpg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Horn-Worm-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Soil.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Soil.jpg 500w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Soil-300x300.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Soil-150x150.jpg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Soil-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Crop.jpg 500w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Crop-300x300.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Crop-150x150.jpg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Healthy-Crop-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n<h2>Don't Break The Cycle!</h2>\nWhen researching crop rotation, you will undoubtedly find lots of diagrams on the internet that say you have to plant in a circular rotation that goes from roots to legumes to leaf to fruits and back around to roots. While this may be a good plan for some, it is by no means the only accurate way to rotate your crops.\nA better method is to look more closely into the family that the plant belongs to and the nutrients it requires. For example, you never want to plant tomatoes in the same plot that you have previously planted potatoes. Though they are completely different vegetables, they belong to the Nightshade family and need the same nutrients from the soil, resulting in poor soil health. Instead, you could plant cabbage to give the soil a break from those heavy feeders. Similarly, you don't want to follow beans with another legume. \nThe biggest thing to remember is that <strong>your soil has to stay active in the soil cycle to stay viable for plant production. </strong>As long as you are rotating crops that won't be harmed from the previous crop and be vulnerable to the same pest pressure, there is a TON of flexibility in what can be planted based on your zone. If you have a window of time that you need to fill between beans and your next planting, cover crops or flowers that have short maturity dates will keep your soil healthy so you don't lose all that amazing nitrogen that your beans have provided.\n\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/\">\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"148\"

garden from Spring all the way into winter and can continue planting crop after crop until the end of your season. But as we mentioned earlier, here in South Georgia, the height of summertime isn't ideal for us to try and keep our vegetable garden growing with a few minor exceptions like sweet potatoes and okra. So for us, this is an ideal time to plant a cover crop like<strong> <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sunn Hemp</a> </strong>or <strong><a href=\"/products/black-oil-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Oil Sunflowers</a> </strong>and keep our soil healthy for our fall garden when temperatures get milder. Then when we're ready for our next planting, we work those cover crops back into the soil, not losing any of the nutrients that they may have siphoned.\nIt really just comes down to a matter of planning, preference, and research. Find out what families and crops thrive in your area and go from there.\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTOMATOES</h3>\n<a href=\"/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/tomatoes/page/2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSWEET CORN</h3>\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/corn-sweet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUCUMBERS</h3>\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/cucumbers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPEPPERS</h3>\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/peppers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOVER CROPS</h3>\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/cover-crops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCABBAGE</h3>\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/cabbage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tONIONS</h3>\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/onions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFLOWERS</h3>\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/flowers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h2>Don't Forget To Keep A Record</h2>\nConsidering some crops need to be on a rotation of sometimes up to 6 years, it can be very easy to forget what has been planted where. Using a garden journal to keep track of what you have planted is going to be a vital part of crop rotation. You can go into as much or as little detail as you want. There's no right or wrong way to keep records. We like to roughly sketch out our garden and label the family, variety, date of planting, and date of harvest. Trust us when we say that having this quick reference will keep you from wasting time, and money, and experiencing a whole lot of frustration in potentially losing a whole crop when there was an easy, free solution.\n<h3>What Beans Are You Growing?</h3>\nCheck out our huge selection of pole beans, bush beans, and other legumes!\n<a href=\"/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/beans/\">\nSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xsbRrdnqFB8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  ",

Adding flowers to your vegetable garden has a ton of long-term and short-term benefits from the blooms to the soil. Year after year in our gardens, we always make room for beautiful blooms. We've narrowed down our top 5 reasons that we always make sure and have flowers in our garden.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Reason 1: Bring On The Pollinators!</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>The first and arguably most important reason to plant flowers in your vegetable garden is to attract pollinators. A pollinator is an insect or animal that carries pollen from male plants to female plants to aid in fertilization. These critters are attracted to the flowers in your garden and will subsequently help to pollinate your nearby vegetables, helping to increase your yields and pollination rates. Even planting pollenless or low-pollen varieties like <a href=\"/?s=ProCut&amp;post_type=product&amp;post_type=product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ProCut Sunflowers</a> are still beneficial not only for their beauty but also for their nectar and keeping all those helpers coming back.</p><p>In short: pollinators are the rock stars of the garden and they absolutely LOVE flowers. So the more flowers, the better. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"768\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-768x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-600x600.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators3-scaled-e1646857099561.jpeg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"768\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-768x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-600x600.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators-scaled-e1646856981966.jpeg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"768\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-768x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-600x600.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pollinators2-scaled-e1646856936207.jpeg 1829w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marigolds-600x400.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Reason 2: Get Some Help With Weeds</h2>\t\t\n\t\t<p>In addition to attracting helpful pollinators, planting flowers densely can help suppress weeds in your garden by shading your soil from the sun. Keeping the sun off of your soil is extremely helpful with weed suppression because the shade that the flowers and foliage provide keeps those pesky weeds from being able to germinate. The root systems of the flowers are also usually quite a bit stronger than those of weeds so they will out-compete them with ease. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a

have been using different flowers as cover crops to help keep nutrients in the soil. In addition to that, planting flowers in spaces that would otherwise be empty in your garden will help with soil erosion, and help keep your soil from getting too compacted. <br>The real standout flower for helping your soil has got to be sunflowers. Depending on the size of your garden and how much space needs to be taken up next to your vegetables, there are so many varieties of sunflower that will suit your needs. If you have a smaller spot, the <a href=\"/product/sungold-dwarf-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sungold Dwarf Sunflower</a> is a perfect choice and if you have a crop of delicate lettuce that could use some protection from the scorching summer sun, you could try planting the absolutely stunning <a href=\"/product/firecracker-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Firecracker Sunflower</a>. <br>But what makes sunflowers so special in helping the overall health of your soil is their unique ability to siphon nutrients out of the soil that other flowers can't. Sunflowers have a really deep tap root and root system that can break into layers of soil and bring them closer to the top of the soil for other plants to use. They're also very salt tolerant so if you've found that your soil has a buildup of salt from either living near the coast or perhaps overusing fertilizers, planting sunflowers can help out!</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Which Flowers Are You Going To Grow This Season?</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCheck out our huge selection of flower seeds!\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/flowers/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSHOP NOW\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h2>Reason 4: Share The Love!</h2>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-683x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-683x1024.jpeg 683w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-1365x2048.jpeg 1365w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-300x450.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bouquet3-scaled.jpeg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<p>Sending flowers to your loved one for Valentine's Day or a beautiful arrangement as a get-well gift for a friend in need is inherently ingrained in all of us as a symbol of love, friendship, respect and so much more. <br>But to take that even a step further and present someone with a hand-picked bouquet of <a href=\"/product/beneficial-insect-wildflower-mix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fresh wildflowers</a> that came directly from your garden and into their hands can deepen that symbol even further.

The curing process can take several weeks depending on your zone, heat, and humidity level. The main thing we want to stress is to make absolutely certain that your onions have completely cured and are totally dried out before storing them. Also, be sure and sort through the entire crop to look for any bulbs that could be of concern in the coming months. Double bulbs, cracked scales or any signs of moisture are all good qualities to go ahead and eat those fresh and not put them up to store.\n<h2>Where Do You Store Onions?</h2>\n<img width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624-683x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624-683x1024.jpeg 683w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624-1366x2048.jpeg 1366w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624-300x450.jpeg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-daniel-dan-7543167-scaled-e1638807479624.jpeg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\">\n\nWe know that there are a ton of ways to store onions, but we have chosen our top 3 methods. The first, and most important step is to pick the right spot to make your onions last for months and months.\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGood Air Circulation</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs Dark As Possible</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCool Temperature</li>\n</ul>\nFinding a cool, dry area with good circulation are the keys to keeping your onions last as long as possible. Moisture and heat will cause onions to prematurely decompose. Finding somewhere dark, like a shed, pantry or, garage, will keep the onions from coming into contact with sunlight and have them sprout. Ideally, storing them between 35ºF - 45ºF will keep the onions at the best temperature for storage.\n<h3>Which Onion Variety Should You Grow?</h3>\nCheck out our handy onion map to see the best variety for your zone!\n<a href=\"/product-category/premium-garden-seeds/onions/\">\nCLICK HERE\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h2>Using Pantyhose To Store Onions</h2>\nA very cost-effective and ingenious way to store onions is using nylon pantyhose. Yes, we said pantyhose! Here's why:\n- The synthetic nylon material will repel moisture and help keep your onions dry.\n- The tiny mesh will let allow good airflow all the way around the bulb.\n- This method allows you to utilize vertical space that is otherwise wasted, like the back of a pantry door or inside a shed.\n- The average cost can be as little as $1.00 to store between 12 - 16 onions per pair of pantyhose.\n\n<strong>Instructions:</strong>\n1. Cut the individual legs off of the pantyhose. Save the top for storing other smaller veggies like shallots or garlic.\n\n2. Drop a single onion bulb to the very bottom of the leg.\n\n3. Tie a knot close to the top of the bulb. Repeat this step until there are approximately 4-6 inches of pantyhose left at the top (between 6-8 onions depending on size).\n\n4. Tie a loop at the top of the hose and hang onions vertically being sure they are not resting against another surface. As you need to use them, cut off the pantyhose just below the knot.\n\n<img width=\"863\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175-863x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175-863x1024.jpg 863w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175-253x300.jpg 253w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175-768x911.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175-1295x1536.jpg 1295w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175-1726x2048.jpg 1726w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175-300x356.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175-600x712.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211203_105902-scaled-e1638806431175.jpg 1952w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px\">\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\tDid You Know?</h3>\n0\nMillion Pounds\n<h3>California is the largest exporter of onions in the United States.

or a root cellar, the screen method may be your best bet. This is simply a frame of some kind with a mesh screen built in between the slats of the frame. Yes, like a screen door. If you don't have an extra screen door laying around, thrift stores, antique stores, and secondhand shops are great places to find old doors. \nWhen storing on a screen, lay all of your onions out in a single layer for maximum air circulation. If you prefer a more custom size, building an onion rack is also a great option. It's very few materials and you can make them any size you'd like and customize it to fit your specific area. \n<h2>Compostable Onion Storage</h2>\nPerhaps the most environmentally-friendly option to store onions is the paper bag method. We really like storing onions this way because the benefits of using a paper shopping bag goes far beyond just storing onions and other produce.\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Compostable-Onion-Storage-1024x461.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Compostable-Onion-Storage-1024x461.jpg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Compostable-Onion-Storage-300x135.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Compostable-Onion-Storage-768x346.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Compostable-Onion-Storage-1536x691.jpg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Compostable-Onion-Storage-2048x922.jpg 2048w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Compostable-Onion-Storage-600x270.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\">\n\nBy doing something as simple as choosing a paper over plastic at the grocery store, you can help eliminate single-use plastics which have a direct impact on the environment. If you are storing your onions indoors, paper shopping bags fit nicely into a cabinet, on a pantry shelf, or tucked away in a dark corner. Simply cut holes into the bags for ventilation purposes, label them, and that's it. They can be re-used for months on end until they deteriorate and need to be replaced.\nThe best part about this method, in our opinion, is that it has the potential to create little to no waste. When your paper bags are past the point of no return, simply shred them and add them to your compost pile. If you're using worm compost, just remove the bottom section of the bag where the adhesive is and shred the rest of it for worms to munch on. Paper grocery bags can be beneficial from the store to the garden.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1SRYcgFK884\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe></iframe></iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  \n\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  \n\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  &amp;t=803s",

For our in-ground plants, we decided to use synthetic black plastic sheeting with the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">Drip Tape Irrigation System</a>.\n<figure><img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-5T-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-5T\"></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-3T-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-3T\"></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-4T-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-4T\"></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-6T-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-6T\"></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-7T-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"HOSS-Strawberry-Mulch-7T\"></figure>\nWhen you use the drip tape system, plant your strawberry plugs at each emitter and bury your tape. Once you've got everything in the ground, that's when you come in with your mulch choice and cover your irrigation under the plant.

However, when heavy frost, snow, or ice is expected, you’ll need to be sure and protect your strawberry plants using the very same mulch you've already applied under the plant. Strawberry plants are, in general, pretty cold hardy but the crowns will get damaged at anything below 15°F. During Spring production, the flowers and fruit can get damaged at anything below 28°F. Applying mulch over the plants will help protect the crowns and new growth from frost damage. We recommend using the same mulch varieties that we mentioned above based on how you've planted. If you're using organic mulch, simply apply a 3”-6” layer over the plants loosely so that moisture and sunlight can still get in but not so much it smothers the plant. If using synthetic materials, just cover the plants with a single layer of sheeting by hand. Once temperatures even out, you’ll want to make sure to remove any mulch you’ve applied. Keeping the row covers on can invite warmer temperatures that can cause a host of issues including rot, insect infestation, premature blooms and other problems that can kill the crop.  You may find yourself applying and removing your mulch several times throughout the season so we suggest keeping it in the rows between the plants between uses but rest assured, it will be worth it at the end of the growing season.\n<h2>Learn More About Growing Strawberries At Home</h2>\n<a href=\"/hoss-university/growing-guides/strawberries/\"> Click Here </a>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu8dDoVE5iM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  ",

That's great news but we know that deciding the best way to start can be overwhelming. Fear not, HOSS Study Hall is here to help. The two methods we explored were starting with a strawberry plant plug and bare root plant. Lucky for you, we've done our research and have determined that strawberry plugs reign supreme when compared side by side.\n<h2>What Is A Strawberry Plug?</h2>\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-300x400.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-600x800.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\n\n<strong>Plant Plug</strong> - Also commonly referred to as a set, is a live plant that arrives with soil already on its roots. Plugs can stay in their trays until ready to transplant into the ground.\n\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<strong>Bare Root</strong> - plants that are in a dormant state and have no soil on their roots on arrival. A good bit of special care needs to be taken with bare root plants when they arrive to protect the root system from damage.\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShop Our Hand Selected Strawberry Plants</h3>\n<a href=\"/product-category/plants/strawberry-plugs/\">\nClick Here\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h2>Strawberry Plugs Are Clearly Superior</h2>\nOne of the most compelling reasons for going with strawberry plant plug is financial. Whether you are a beginner gardener or a seasoned vet, when you invest in plants, the thought of them not producing can be a real heartbreaker on your wallet. On average, you will lose between 15% - 20% of bare root plants whereas plugs will usually only have a 1% - 2% loss overall. Because plugs arrive with soil already on the roots, they will usually establish a lot quicker, resist soil shock, and have an easier transition into dormancy when you're planting in the fall.\n\n<a href=\"https://hosstools.com/\">\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"148\" src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-768x148.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-768x148.jpg 768w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-300x58.jpg 300w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-1024x197.jpg 1024w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-1536x296.jpg 1536w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner-600x116.jpg 600w, https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOSS-Banner.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n<h2>Everything You Need For A Great Garden!</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"42481\" href=\"?add-to-cart=42481\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mortgage-lifter-tomato-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\">\nMortgage Lifter Tomato\n</a>\nRated <strong>5.00</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$3.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"42505\" href=\"?add-to-cart=42505\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/goldprize-squash/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/goldprize-squash-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/goldprize-squash/\">\nGoldprize Squash\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$4.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"42498\" href=\"?add-to-cart=42498\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/long-slim-cayenne-pepper/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/long-slim-cayenne-pepper-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/long-slim-cayenne-pepper/\">\nLong Slim Cayenne Pepper\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$3.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"112416\" href=\"?add-to-cart=112416\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/flash-collard/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/flash-collard-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/flash-collard/\">\nFlash Collard\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$4.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"55884\" href=\"?add-to-cart=55884\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/homestead-tomato/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/homestead-tomato-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/homestead-tomato/\">\nHomestead Tomato\n</a>\nRated <strong>5.00</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$3.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"57733\" href=\"?add-to-cart=57733\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/ghost-pepper/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ghost-pepper-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/ghost-pepper/\">\nGhost Pepper\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$4.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"45484\" href=\"/products/cosmos-sensation-mix/\">Select options</a>\n<a href=\"/products/cosmos-sensation-mix/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cosmos-sensation-mix-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/cosmos-sensation-mix/\">\nCosmos Sensation Mix\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$3.99</bdi> – <bdi>$14.99</bdi>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<!-- description -->\n<!-- popup content -->\n<a data-product_id=\"208655\" href=\"?add-to-cart=208655\">Add to cart</a>\n<a href=\"/products/camaro-pmr-pumpkin/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosstools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/camaro-pmr-pumpkin-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Product Thumb\">\n</a>\n<!-- categories -->\n<!-- end categories -->\n<a href=\"/products/camaro-pmr-pumpkin/\">\nCamaro PMR Pumpkin\n</a>\nRated <strong>0</strong> out of 5\n\n<bdi>$4.99</bdi>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pro Tip: Plant Your Strawberries In The Fall.

With bare root plants of the June bearing variety, you won't have a crop the first year. Once you put your plugs in the ground, fertilize and mulch them, they'll go dormant over the winter. As warmer weather rolls around and the plants come out of dormancy, you'll have a nice large crop of juicy, red, sweet strawberries over the course of a few weeks in Spring and early Summer.\n\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu8dDoVE5iM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe></iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  \n\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  ",

However, these cucurbit crops are the most susceptible to powdery mildew and downy mildew which are very harsh diseases in the vegetable garden. When temperatures start to rise up and we experience high humidity or moisture in the air that's when the powdery mildew begins to really affect the plants. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What is Powdery Mildew?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A severe fungal disease that can really affect a wide variety of plants is powdery mildew. This powdery mildew is most commonly known to affect plants in the <em>cucurbit, nightshade</em>, and <em>legume</em> families. Once the fungus begins to take over control of one of your plants it will fill the plant with a layer of mildew made up of many spores along the top of the leaves. Those spores will then carry to other plants by the wind. If you've experienced powdery mildew in the past, new outbreaks come from dormat spores in old vegetative material or weeds nearby in the garden. Powdery mildew affects your plants by slowing down growth, reduce fruit yield, and the overall quality of fruits. Unlike other fungal diseases, powdery mildew thrives in warmer temperatures and dry/humid temperatures. In order to identify powdery mildew in your garden, it usually starts out as circular white spots on the top of plants but may grow on the undersides as well. Since young foliage is most susceptible you should ensure you have an effective pest control schedule early on in the vegetable garden to avoid any severe issues. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Treat Powdery/Downy Mildew</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If are experiencing this powdery and downy mildew disease on your plants, we highly recommend treating it with Bi-Carb Fungicide. This fungicide will disrupt the cell in the powdery mildew and will cure it. Another way to avoid powdery mildew in the garden is to plant cucurbit varieties that have disease resistance. Some of the older plant leaves are experiencing some downy mildew which starts out with yellow spots on the leaves. As the yellow spots get bigger they start to degrade the leaves and eventually create large brown rough spots on the leaves. To ensure our new growth does not experience the same issue we spray our new foliage with <a href=\"/products/complete-disease-control/\">Complete Disease Control</a> and <a href=\"/products/liquid-copper-fungicide/\">Liquid Copper Fungicide</a> in order to protect that new plant foliage. These fungicides are organic pesticides that can be used as a foliar spray which will effectively take care of the plant disease by spraying the top of the leaves. The most important way to ensure you have better success with controlling these diseases is to identify which disease is affecting your plants and begin to understand how you can control them in the vegetable garden. Once you identify these diseases you will be able to effectively kill off and overall control many diseases in your garden.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Growing Blue Bayou Pumpkins</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Along with his cucurbit varieties, Greg is growing some hybrid <a href=\"/products/blue-bayou-pumpkin/\">Blue Bayou Pumpkins</a> that provide heirloom beauty with a strong disease package such as resistance to powdery and downy mildew. This pumpkin variety produces trailing vines that supply large 15-20 lb pumpkins. Their unique color profile consists of a light blue exterior with deep ribbing along the outer coating.

With cherry tomatoes having less foliage and smaller fruits, gardeners have more options on what they choose to support their tomatoes.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Trellising, in its simplest form, is just supporting the plant as it grows. It is essential to do as your plants start to mature and need adequate airflow and space. Trellising also helps keep plants and leaves off of the ground to prevent fungal and bacterial diseases as well as insects. We see trellising used in many gardens with everything from melons to squash.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many gardeners understand the time it takes to manually weave a trellis through each plant, also known as the technique Florida weave. This method can be very time consuming as you have to do it multiple times as the plant continues to grow.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Gardeners, especially those with larger gardens, will decide to turn to cattle fencing to skip all the hassle. Cattle fencing can be beneficial as it is easier to stake in the ground compared to the Florida weave. The downside of doing using cattle panels with cherry tomatoes or any smaller fruit for that matter is the lack of flexibility within the steel of the cattle fencing, which leads to breakage in the plant. One alternative to try with cherry tomatoes is the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-59-x-328/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hortonova Trellis Netting</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Hortonova Trellis is described as a thicker fishing line and rolls out in a very manageable way. This trellis is as simple as cutting it to your desired length, zip tie-ing it to one side, and then stretching it tightly across the row and zip tie-ing it to the other side. You are allowing your plants to firmly grow vertically up the net while also having its flexibility without breaking the plant.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another tip when using netting to trellis your plants is to add posts every 10-15 feet and zip-tie the net there as well. Adding the extra support will allow your netting to stay upright and not sag with the weight of the fruits.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Benefits of the Hortonova Trellis</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The simple Hortonova trellis netting would be great to try on any cherry tomato variety such as The </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/sweetie-cherry-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sweetie Cherry Tomato</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> or The </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/black-zebra-cherry-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Black Zebra Cherry Tomato.</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> The Hortonova isn't made just for smaller fruits, though. It is strong enough to hold up even varieties of cucumbers like </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/diomede-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Diomede</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stonewall</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, as well as the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/kentucky-blue-pole-bean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kentucky Blue Pole Beans</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though the netting with the cucumbers might sag a tad bit when they are getting ready to harvest compared to the cherry tomatoes or pole beans, the netting allows you to stretch it as tight as you can to prevent the fruit from being on the ground.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Though the netting does hold up great even on heavier cucumbers, we suggest to not use this Hortonova trellis netting on butternut squash or any heavier winter squash because it isn't quite strong enough. For smaller fruits like our cherry tomatoes, this netting works perfectly.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The netting comes in various lengths, but there are benefits with having the longer roll as it can never go bad. The Hortonova trellis is sold on the website up to 328 feet long. Another bonus about this netting is its UV resistance, so it will never deteriorate in the sun but rather can be used year after year.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Check out the video below to see exactly how to set up this simple cherry tomato trellis.

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When Should I Start Digging my Potatoes?</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Irish Potatoes are one of the most maintenance-free crops, but the big question is, how do I know when my potatoes are ready? Digging potatoes is the hardest part about growing a potato plant. You will know it is the right time, though when the vines start dying back, and the weather is consistently warm and dry. If you dig your potatoes up and there is no disease set up on them and only one or two rodded potatoes, you know you tug them up at the correct time.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another thing to check for to determine if it was a good harvest is to see if they are all consistent in size. For differing varieties, this will change, but if you have the same variety planted on a row, then you want all of them to be about the same size. If you have some that were small in one area that may be a sign of poor soil or lack of water, you want to check this out, so you are ready for the next time you plant. </span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Making sure that you have good potatoes to dig up, starts with your soil. The best potato growing soil is excellent and sandy, leaving room for your potato roots. It doesn't stop there though potatoes aren't complicated and will be well worth your money as long as you make sure to take care of them once they are in the ground. You can do this by keeping plenty of water on them, fertilizing when needed, and hilling them a couple of times. </span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Best Potato Varieties to Grow </span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Digging Potatoes is all fun and games but you can't get there if you don't pick the perfect variety to plant first. Potato plants come in all shapes and sizes, and it is always fun to grow the right mix of all of them. Our four most successful varieties of potatoes are listed below. </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><a href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\">Red Norland</a> is the first to pop up out of all the potatoes in your vegetable garden. This potato is a hybrid of the traditional red potato. Still, it has a darker red skin that has a high disease resistance to scab, Rhizoctonia, and potato virus. The Red Norland can be grown in many different climates and produces heavy yields. Its white </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">flesh is excellent for steaming and boiling, which makes it perfect for a low country boil! </span>\n</li>\n \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The <a href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\">Yukon Gold</a> potato is probably our tastiest potato and the next one to come out of the garden with a 100-day maturity rate. Its tan skin and light brown flecks with a bright yellow flesh will leave you no need to butter these melt-in-your-mouth treats. Yukon Gold Potato produces heavy yields of medium to large-sized potatoes that are slightly elongated. This variety is known for its versatility in the kitchen for frying, baking, mashing, roasting, and more!</span></li>\n \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This next variety produces potatoes with dark, reddish-purple skins and a vibrant, deep purple flesh. The <a href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\">Adirondack Blue Potato</a> is purple in flesh and rich in antioxidants. The crop is medium to large with about an 85-day maturity rate. The Adirondack Blue potato keeps its color when cooked, leaving you tons of fun in the kitchen making blue mashed potatoes or potato salad!</span></li>\n \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Our <a href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\">German Butterball</a> is a late-season variety, blue-tag certified, and has excellent storage capability. It has a golden-yellow flesh that will melt in your mouth! When given the time to reach full size, they are delicious but also work great as baby potatoes for canning or pot roasts. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Watch the video below to see Greg dig these four varieties up.

Tomatoes come from the ovary of a flowering plant, making it a seed-bearing fruit. Others like this that we usually classify as vegetables are eggplants and peppers. Tomatoes are a favorite item in the garden because of their excellent taste; they are delicious.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Like many crops, there are two different types of tomato seeds, heirlooms, and hybrids. Heirlooms are original seeds that have not been altered in any way. They are passed down from generation to generation, and many families like to continue on that tradition of growing them. Some even want to rely on them instead of the hybrids, at Hoss Tools we have a few heirloom tomato varieties such as,</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/homestead-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Homestead Tomato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/brandywine-pink-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brandywine Pink Tomato </span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/boxcar-willie-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Boxcar Willie Tomato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/black-krim-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Black Krim Tomato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/mortgage-lifter-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mortgage Lifter Tomato</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hybrids are cross-pollinated seeds to help produce extra fruit and to have higher disease and pests resistances. Everyone has their preference on which seed variety they prefer, and for us here at Hoss Tools, we have found that variety to be the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bella Rosa Tomatoes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. They are a pelleted see, and you can count on those for production because they are that hybrid seed. Two other tomatoes that are great hybrids and determinate tomatoes are the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/mountain-glory-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mountain Glory</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brickyard</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. All three of these have that disease resistance as well as delicious fruit.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most people don't grow tomatoes because they are easy. After all, they are quite the opposite. Tomato growing takes time and loving on but is well worth it when they are ready to eat. Tomatoes have a longer maturity rate, so they do better if they start as transplants as that takes about two weeks off their harvest-ready time. Your plants are going to need a lot of nitrogen and fertilizer. They also need some support when they are starting to mature and need help standing up. There are many options for this, such as the Florida weave, hog panels, and the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-59-x-328/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hortonova Trellis</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Trellising will help them from getting blown over and will keep your fruit off the ground to prevent insects.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Best Tomato Sandwich</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Though tomatoes aren't the most expensive fruit, there is something about eating one that you grew yourself. That gratification of being self-sustaining is such a great feeling, and here at Hoss Tools, we want to help you achieve that and enjoy the groceries you are making in your garden, so here is one of our favorite tomato recipes.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once your tomatoes have grown right up, and you have been fertilizing them real good, you are going to get a big beefsteak type tomato that is perfect for slicing. It has excellent flavor and is fruitful; once you pick your harvest, it is time to put those groceries to the test. The recipe right here is a Mr.Greg Hoss special recipe and his favorite thing to do once his tomatoes are ready.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">First, you want to get you two pieces of fresh light bread and smear you some mayonnaise all over both sides. Then you want to take your good ripe tomatoes and slice it up into pieces for the bread. Once you have a good bit of tomato slices, you should layer them all over one part of the bread. After you have your desired amount of tomatoes, then you want to sprinkle you some pepper and salt on both sides. Then slap your two pieces together, and that is what Mr.Greg calls one of the best meals ever, even better than a payday!!</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CLICK on the video below to see Mr.Greg make his famous recipe and to see how his tomato plants are doing.</span>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FcJRBYku7WY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=20&amp;t=0s",

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Best Potatoes to Plant</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Potatoes are one of the easiest things to plant in your garden as they do not need much uptake to produce, but fertilizing potatoes is the way to go if you want to take your yield to the next level, and that can get a little tricky. As the days in South Georgia are getting longer, it is getting into tater time, and Hoss Tools wants to help you navigate through growing and fertilizing your potatoes. Nothing beats going out and scratching you a potato to take inside and boil up for dinner. So how do you get your crop to that point?</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">First, we need to talk about getting them in the ground and what should be in your soil. There are many different varieties you can grow, everything from </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/all-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">All Blue</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> potatoes to a general </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yukon Gold</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Your method of planting is going to be around the same for all Irish Potatoes. In regards to your soil, potatoes like to live anywhere from 5-6.5 pH level, so you want to make sure you have plenty of that organic matter in there. When planting potatoes, we suggest you plant them four to six inches apart with a 36-inch row spacing. The spacing will give them ample room but also keep them close enough together, so your rows aren't too spread apart.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With all crops, it is imperative to have you a good crop rotation so that you don't soak all that nutrients up out of the soil. Figure out a plan for what you are going to plant before and after your potatoes to make sure you are a good steward of your soil. Make sure to remember that potatoes are in the nightshade family, meaning it isn't healthy to plant where other nightshades have been like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant. Look out for sandy soil to know that you may not have suitable growing soil anymore and figure out how you can add nutrients back into it.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fertilizing the Potatoes</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is essential to fertilize your potatoes once they are in the ground and throughout the weeks. Though potatoes don't have many pests, they do struggle with a little bit of Blight and the Colorado Potato Beetle here in the south. That Colorado Potato Beetle, you have to look for eggs that might be waiting to hatch under the leaves. One way to fight against that is to alternate between </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spinosad</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/neem-oil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Neem Oils</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which are both insect sprays. Rotating weeks and starting while their young as well as making sure that you are spraying under the leaves and getting good coverage will help you see success in your potatoes.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once your plants are in the ground, there are a few things you can do to make sure that you are getting the most bang for your buck. In a cup, you are going to want to mix a 10-10-10 synthetic fertilizer and pour it down in the roots of the plant. The benefit of this fertilizer is that it will help boost your yield to the next level as well as gain that resistance to pests and diseases. Once you do that once with the cup when it is young, you should go in there again, but wait until they are at your desired height of four to eight inches tall. That will continue to help the plant as it matures.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Though potatoes aren't expensive in the grocery store, we want everyone to be encouraged to grow their food! Gardening is a family activity everyone can enjoy and reap the benefits.

If you are raised in the south, black-eyed peas may be your favorite, either way, there is a type for everyone. What is even better is when they are fresh out of your garden instead of from the grocery store. Here at Hoss Tools, we want everyone to be able to grow their food, and in this blog, we are going to talk about some different varieties of peas as well as what is the best way to grow them and store them. We hope this encourages you to go out and start your garden.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Our two main categories with peas are English peas (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/mr-big-pea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mr.Bi</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">g, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/green-arrow-pea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Green Arrow</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/oregon-sugar-pod-pea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Oregon Sugar Pod</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">), and Field peas (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/summertime-pinkeye-pea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Summertime Pinkeye</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/dixie-lee-pea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Dixie Lee</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">,</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/zipper-cream-pea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Zipper Cream</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">). There is all kind of seeds out there, and here at Hoss Tools we have many varieties of both, and it just comes down to your preference. Field peas have more of the bean taste, whereas the English varieties are the traditional sweet green ones. We have started to enjoy growing the Summertime Pinkeye field pea, though, because the crop grows at the top, it is effortless to harvest also, this variety is easy to shell. They are a purple pull, but its a green pea that creates a clear broth. In the south, we grow our English peas in the early spring, and once those get harvested, we switch over to the Field peas.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So How do I Grow Them?</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Growing the perfect pea takes many different steps, but what we have found to work best isn't too tricky. With any pea, you are going to want to plant them four inches apart and one inch deep. This spacing tends to work out well. We suggest planting with a walk-behind seeder like our</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://hosstools.com/walk-behind-garden-seeder-planter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Hoss Garden Seeder</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and usually using the number five seed plate. Looking at the size of your seed and seeing which seed plate you are going to use is critical because if the hole is too big, you may end up wasting seed or jamming the plate. Planting on drip tape is also very beneficial with peas in helping to conserve water. You want to harvest your crop when they look full and like they could be shelled easily. Depending on the variety, they will be anywhere from four to eight inches in length. Most varieties have an average of about 60 days until maturity. Meaning that in about two months after you plant, you will be ready to have some black-eyed peas for dinner.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ways to Preserve</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After harvesting your crop, there are going to be way more than you can eat, if you plant a lot as we do. Though we always suggest sharing with your friends, there are also many ways to make sure they don't go bad. A couple of different ways you can preserve the pea itself is to freeze them, salt them, dry them, or canning. You can also maintain the whole pod by freezing or salting. Dried beans store very well and can get rehydrated for those special occasions. Black-eye peas are also a great addition to fresh salads and soups. These different ways will help you keep your crop good and fresh until you are ready to cook them!</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you want to know more about the Hoss garden seeder or growing your food, even if it is not peas, check out the video below!</span>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwMcaCGJefA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  &amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=21",

Well, in no time, we mean at least 80 days. As always, the first step in planting anything is choosing which variety you want to work. There are many seeds out there, and Hoss Tools offers many different varieties that meet the wants of every sweet corn eater. Some of the top three here are the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/silver-queen-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Silver Queen</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/ambrosia-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ambrosia</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, and this year even the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/honey-select-sweet-corn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Honey Select Sweet Corn</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Honey Select is a triple sweet variety and is an All-American winner. The ears grow to be around eight inches, which is a giant ear. Honey Select Sweet Corn is a triple sweet hybrid that contains the perfect combination of 75% sugary-enhanced and 25% super sweet kernels. Many people enjoy this variety because of its big window, for when you have to harvest it, this is due to its field holding ability. It also stores very well in the freezer, giving you many options when it comes time to cook it. Some of our favorite ways to cook it are eating it off the cob, making cream corn, and as always sharing it with our friends.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sweet corn does best when planted in the spring after the last frost date. Sweet corn can be grown throughout all of the warmer months as long as you have time to harvest it before the first frost. Hoss Tools recommends succession planting with sweet corn, and what that means is after you gather it, you go in and plant you some more rows where you just had it. Most small scale farmers do at least two plantings first in the early spring, then in the late summer.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Garden Seeder Tips</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When it comes time to planting the sweet corn and getting your plots ready, it is essential to remember to plant in blocks and not long rows. We suggest planting corn in a square plot with rows on 30-36″ spacing. Planting a few long rows will result in poor germination and the absence of kernels on the cobs. The reason behind this is because unlike most plants, corn pollinates by the wind and not by the bees.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After you have your plots ready, we suggest you go in with a walk-behind planter like the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://hosstools.com/seeders/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hoss Garden Seeder</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> using the number 4 seed plate so that your seeds are 4 inches apart and you want to plant one inch deep. Another beneficial tip when planting corn is doing it on drip tape. The drip tape helps get the water throughout the roots avoiding diseases on the foliage. If you do decide to lay drip tape, then you are going to want to plant right on the lines of the tape to make sure the water reaches it. Doing the seeder at a one-inch depth will make sure it doesn't puncture the drip tape.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once your seeds are all planted, you want to go in and give it a good watering immediately. If you are on drip tape, leave it turned on for about an hour. This water will help the seed to lock in good. Now that you are all set with your plant, keep a good eye on them for the next 80 days, and soon you will start to have some groceries out in the field.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you found this blog helpful, tune in to the video below to see these tips on growing Honey Select Sweet Corn in action on Gardening with Greg!</span>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/raA9IQllZ2Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  &amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=22",

There are many watermelon tips out there, so we need to start from the beginning, the seed. With almost all plants, there are two choices, Hybrid or Heirloom. An heirloom seed is one that has not been altered but past down many generations. Most Heirlooms originate from families in the 1800s including some of Hoss tools favorite watermelon varieties such as</span>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/charleston-gray-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Charleston Gray </span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/georgia-rattlesnake-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Georgia Rattlesnake</span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/moon-and-stars-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moon and Stars</span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/sugar-baby-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sugar Baby</span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/tendersweet-orange-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tender Sweet Orange</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The other option when choosing a seed is Hybrid varieties, and many people choose these because of there likelihood to produce a higher yield. The cross-pollination of the same plant produces a hybrid seed but different varieties. Hybrids are one of the main contributors to the rise in agricultural output in the last century. Not only do they usually produce a higher yield, but they can also have other benefits such as being sweeter. It all just depends on your style of gardening and what you like to eat. Hoss Tools also offers many Hybrid varieties, including </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/crimson-sweet-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crimson Sweet</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which is an All American variety.

You can either direct seed or transplant, and there are benefits to both, but here at Hoss Tools, we recommend transplanting, and here is why. Watermelons take about 85-95 days to mature and starting them off in a seed tray, and then transplanting is going to give you about a two-week head start of everybody. Transplanting can be vital if you are a small scale market farmer because you can get to selling them before everyone else does. Also, for out friends up north that have a smaller growing season, this transplanting method will make sure you have plenty of time to harvest your watermelons. When you see your seeds have started to get nice good leaves on them and are strong enough to pull up the roots, then you know it is time to put them in the garden.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When you are planting your transplants into the ground, you want to make sure they are far enough apart to give them plenty of room. Watermelons grow in a vine-like structure, making them spread out on the ground needing plenty of room to grow. Another thing to consider with watermelons is the dense cover they create, making it harder to get water down to the root system. You want to make sure you are watering under the leaves to prevent diseases on the foliage. Deciding to use drip irrigation could take your crop to the next level.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One last tip to make sure you are getting the most out of your crop is to make sure you have plenty of pollinators. Lack of pollinators is usually the reason for many problems in people's home gardens if you can't get bees nearby plant you some cut flowers in your garden to draw you some insects to get the flower turning in to fruit.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hopefully, these simple watermelon tips will help take your garden to the next level, check out the video below to find out some more tips!!</span>\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTsUp_diE6E?list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=23\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:47:02-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to Know if your Garden Needs Help</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soil is the main ingredient in every great garden, and you have to understand the tillage of your soil to be able to help your garden. So what is good tillage? Tillage is the suitability of your soil to grow. Characteristics of good soil are that it will crumble in your hand while also having large pieces. It will have lots of organic matter and hold nutrients and water well. You will know if it is bad soil or not suitable to grow in if it has a powdery look or it doesn't hold nutrients and water well.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another thing to look for when trying to spot lousy tillage is if there is an impacted or crusted layer on top. That layer will cause water not to soak in, making the nutrients die down.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We all want to be good stewards of our soil, and growing a garden is doing just that. If your soil is not suitable to grow, then how can we be good stewards? These next few steps will help your soil become nutrient-rich and help you produce the most amount of fruit.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tip 1 to Help your Garden- Make it Organic.</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The first important step in helping your garden has good soil is making sure it has plenty of organic matter in it. The main way many people do this is by adding compost. Compost can be any organic matter that has decomposed, you can start your compost pile, or you can get manure. Both of those ways will help boost your soil nutrients and the overall tillage of your soil. We take and take from our garden, but we have to remember that we must feed our earth as well to make sure we get the most out of it.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tip 2-Change it Up</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crop rotation is significant in all scales of gardening/farming. Another way to add nutrients to the soil is by having those cover crops before you plant. Do your research on what type of cover crop will be best for your soil. For a garden that is still really lacking that nutrients, we suggest that you do a mix of </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/winter-rye/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rye</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Buckwheat</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Those two will add the most organic material back into the soil. All soils are different, though, and a lot of it depends on your weather. There are many cover crops out there, and if you mix the right ones, you can get the most out of your soil.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also, know what crops you planted in that plot the season before to make sure you're not planting the same species. If you continue to plant the same family in the same place, it will use all of those specific nutrients that family needs leaving the next ones to die. That is why it is essential to have a cover crop in between two crops. Doing that will make sure your soil is getting replenished. </span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tip 3-Do Not Beat your Soil.</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When we say don't beat your soil, we mean it. One big thing that hurts your garden that many people don't realize is over tilling it. When you continue till after it is needed, it continues to break up the soil making it harder for the soil to hold water and the nutrients it needs. After you cut down your cover crop, you can till it in one good time then use your </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://hosstools.com/hoss-wheel-hoe-packages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">wheel hoe</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> to get the soil ready. You don't want to cultivate your soil with the tiller but with something else instead of the wheel hoe. That over tilling is where you get the powdery look, and when you are continuing to break it up after it's needed, it will cause long term problems.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Check out the video below to see the effects of over-tilling!!</span>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NugpHCHxU6U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=24",

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Something New in 2019- SEEDS</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As we are continuing to expand here at Hoss Tools, we want to meet the everyday needs of our customers. That has to lead us to the decision to start selling new seeds! We have been trying to answer the question of what can we offer that others cannot? After much research and deliberation, Hoss Tools came to the idea of providing our customers with the full package. We are excited to offer not only the tools to help our customer's gardens grow but now the crop itself. We are truly living out our purpose of helping everyone grow their food.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At our warehouse in Norman Park, Georgia, we have added a seed facility to help us meet this new demand. The facility is climate and humidity-controlled. The seed room will help us hold on to the germination of them as well as keep their shelf life as long as possible. We are keeping the climate at 60 degrees and the humidity at 40% so that pests and insects can't grow on our product. This controlled room also helps us keep our seeds dry, which again helps increase the shelf life. We are different from the many competitors that are keeping seeds outdoors or just in a basement, which decreases the vitality of the plant. With all our products, we want to give you the best opportunity once it is in your hands, and that is no different with our new seeds.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Why Hoss Tools?</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As we decided to venture down this new product line, we knew we wanted to put the best out there. We have decided to focus on giving our gardeners many unique hybrid seeds that will help you produce the most crop. Many farmers have access to these seeds, but they are very hard to find for small scale market farmers and others. We want to be a place that you can get seed to grow any crop you'd like, even the ones that you can't find on just any shelf. Some of those include,</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bella Rosa Tomato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/blue-bayou-pumpkin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Blue Bayou Pumpkin</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/jimmy-red-corn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jimmy Red Corn</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/yellow-moon-and-stars-watermelon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yellow Moon and Stars Watermelon</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">All of these hybrids, along with many others we will be offering, offer high disease and pest resistance and will help flourish your garden. One other big thing Hoss Tools wants to focus on to give you the best product is its packaging. On every seed packet, there will be a picture of the crop, the number of seeds, and the germination rate. It is vital to have all of this on the packet, so the customer knows what they are buying. We are also offering packaging in many sizes, and if there isn't a size on the website that fits your needs, all you have to do is call, and we will pack to order. Same-day shipping will be offered with our seeds so that every person who orders seed on our website will have it in their hands and gardens as soon as possible.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hoss Tools is continuing to grow and will continue to expand the seeds we will be offering.

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tips for the Perfect Potato</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nothing beats the taste of a potato that has been grown in your backyard. Though potatoes aren't that expensive, digging up the perfect potato straight from your garden to take inside to wash and throw in the pan is not only a great taste but a great memory and feeling of accomplishment.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So how do you get your potato to that point? With these few tips in just a couple of short months, you will not need to go to the grocery store to make your next batch of mashed potatoes. Also, while you are becoming a pro try growing some </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Adirondak Blue Potatoes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and make your family blue mashed potatoes, I promise it will be a hit!</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Preparing for the Crop</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With any crop, preparation is crucial, and potatoes are no different. Irish Potatoes are in the nightshade family along with tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers. Having a good crop rotation is vital, and you need to remember not to plant your potatoes where these were before. Being cautious of this will make sure your soil stays nutrient-rich for many years to come.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another way to help your crop rotation is to plant cover crops in your offseason. Mustards are a great cover crop to prepare your soil for potatoes. About three or four weeks before you are ready to plant your potatoes, you are going to want to go into that mustard plant and cut it down and till it in the soil, so it has time to decompose before you plant your potatoes.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To know when you want to plant your potatoes you are going to have to check your local weather station and see when they predict the last frost to be, once you get that date go back and plan to plant two to three weeks before that. For us in South Georgia, that usually means late February will be ideal planting time for our Irish Potatoes, but it can vary every year.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Growing the Perfect Potato</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many different varieties of Irish Potatoes you can plant for beginner gardeners trying to figure out which plant works best for you, and your soil is a challenging task. Try planting three or four different varieties in one row each right by each other and compare which ones do best in your soil. Remember, you want to plant potatoes in the highest and driest part of your plot to avoid rot.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When you have your variety, and it is about four days out before you want to start planting, get your potatoes and an excellent sharp-bladed knife ready. You are going to want to cut three to four eyes per piece, this does not have to be perfect, but we find having around three or four eyes do the trick. As you are cutting and determining how many pieces to cut, think that about every 40 foot you will need around ten pounds of potato pieces.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As you finish cutting your pieces, you are going to want them to sit out for about three to four days. As they sit out the flesh will seal over and prevent moisture from going in or out, doing this again will help you from getting rot in your potatoes. After those few days pass, you are all ready to plant your pieces in the ground!</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Irish Potato Varieties</span></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yukon Gold Potato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">German Butterball Potato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/all-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">All Blue Potato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/adirondack-blue-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Adirondack Blue Potato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/kennebec-white-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kennebec White Potato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/french-fingerling-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">French Fingerling</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/austrian-crescent-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Austrian Crescent Potato</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/red-norland-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Red Norland Potato</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Check out the video below to answer some of your questions and to see this process in action!!</span>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvlEJvk9oMk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;t=4s",

Sunflowers, especially the ProCut variety, are a beneficiary to any garden by attracting pollinators. Not only do they draw the pollinators, but they will also add beneficial insects, which will reduce the harmful pest pressure to the rest of the crops.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ProCut sunflowers are the preferred sunflower variety for the cut flower industry. These sunflowers also make beautiful additions to any cut flower bouquet. Growing six to seven feet tall, this single, smaller stem with a big head makes for a perfect vase. They are also pollen-less, meaning that once you take it inside, it's not going to drip pollen anywhere.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One tip many flower growers don't know is your flowers are ready to go inside before you realize. To get the highest storage potential, harvest your blooms when they are still closed or slightly open. Once the flowers get cut and go in the water, they will stay big and bloomed for up to a week compared to the usual two or three days.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grow the Best Sunflower for your Garden</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ProCut Sunflowers can be direct-seeded or transplanted. If you decide to direct seed, it can get done quickly with our </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://hosstools.com/walk-behind-garden-seeder-planter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hoss Garden Seeder</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which is a walk-behind planter. Just make sure that you choose the right seed tray because, with some variety packs of seeds, the size may vary.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunflowers also produce well by transplants. Using a seed starting tray, you can make sure they are taken care of and root properly before inserting in the ground. You will know your transplants are ready to go in the field when you can easily pull them from the tray, and they stay together.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When planting ProCut Sunflowers, you will find they grow well in double rows with drip irrigation. To maximize your garden space and to get the most out of your drip tape, you can lay one row down and then plant on both sides. If you would like your sunflowers to grow with big heads and talk thick stalks, we suggest planting with plenty of room for them compared to if you are planting to attract the bees where you can put them closer together. </span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We offer many different ProCut varieties in several colors, including </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/procut-lemon-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lemon</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Orange</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/procut-plum-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Plum</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/procut-red-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Red</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/procut-white-nite-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">White Nite</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, and</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/procut-red-lemon-bicolor-sunflower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Red Lemon Bicolor. </span></a>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How-To Cut the Perfect Flower</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A bouquet can range anywhere from $20-$100 dollars, or you can go out to the garden and make your own! For some of our men, you would be surprised and how much this plot can come in handy when you make your woman mad! Being able to go out in the yard and make her a pretty bouquet will make any woman smile, no matter how bad you messed up!</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, about 60 days after you have gone in and planted your flowers, they are going to be ready for the most beautiful centerpiece. The perfect way to create a bouquet is to get a vase or a wide-mouthed mason jar. You then want to take your cabbage knife or a sharp kitchen knife and cut the blooms that look like they are about to open. Please fill up your vase with a beautiful arrangement of colors. You can do this by planting our flower mixes, which is a variety of different flower seeds. Once you have your bouquet, fill the vase up with water, and there you go!!</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For more flower and vegetable garden tips, check out the video below to learn on Gardening with Greg!</span>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHOFAdD9h-s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=14",

    "title": "Warm-Season Cover Crops will be the Best Thing to Happen to your Soil",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:47:00-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What is the Best Warm-Season Cover Crop?</h2>\nCover crops are a great way to improve the health and nutrients of your soil. Warm-season cover crops work explicitly great as a transition between spring and fall gardens. In South Georgia, that means we can plant warm-season cover crops anywhere from early spring until late fall. So how do you know which one to use?\n\nAll cover crops offer a variety of benefits, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fixing atmospheric nitrogen and adding it to soils</li>\n \t<li>Building soils by adding organic matter known as “green manure.”</li>\n \t<li>Controlling erosion by reducing water runoff and nutrient leaching</li>\n \t<li>Suppressing weed growth by providing a dense foliage canopy</li>\n \t<li>Managing pests by reducing harmful nematodes and soil fungi</li>\n</ul>\nMany gardeners use several different cover crops to make a \"cocktail\" specific for their needs. They make their decision based on soil needs and what was planted in the plot before. For example, if you planted something in the Nightshade family such as peppers, eggplant, potatoes, and tomatoes, you wouldn't want to follow that up with another type of nightshade in that same plot until after you do a cover crop. If you don't break up the planting with a cover crop, you could rob your soil of all its nutrients, making it unplantable.\n\nThe following seeds are the warm-season cover crops Hoss Tools offers:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"/products/iron-clay-pea/\">Iron Clay Pea</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>All About Buckwheat</h2>\nCover crops are unique to each soil type and zone area, so it is hard to say which one is the best. For our soil here in zone 8b, where we had previously planted summer squash, we decided that Buckwheat would help it the best. Buckwheat is mainly good at weed suppression because of its fast growth and ability to outspread thee weeds. In one specific plot, we were dealing with pigweeds and crabgrass, which helped us make our decision of using Buckwheat. The Buckwheat will spread out over the weeds, not allowing any sun to reach them, which eventually kills off the weeds.\n\nAnother advantage of Buckwheat is the organic matter it provides to the soil. Adding organic matter to your soil loosens the topsoil, which increases drainage capabilities. Making sure your soil can accurately take in water is a critical ingredient in having a fruitful garden.\n\nEven if you have the perfect soil and seed, if you have no pollinators, you can still end up with no vegetables or fruits. For our average gardener, they cannot bring in a hive of bees, but they can do things to draw in those pollinators organically. Buckwheat can help with that too!! Four to six weeks after planting, Buckwheat will put off a small flower attracting pollinators to the garden.\n\nWhen planting Buckwheat you can go in with a seeder to plant it or broadcast plant it in the plot. Broadcast seeding is scattering the seed, by hand or mechanically, over an area. If you decide to broadcast seed it, you will need to go in and rake it very well, so the seeds are about 1/2 inch deep. The rate of Buckwheat is three pounds for every 1,000 square feet. So with a 500-foot plot, you will only need one and a half pounds.\n\nAfter two to three weeks, the flowers and Buckwheat will be ready to mow down and be incorporated in the soil so that your next crop can quickly reap its benefits. It would be best if you did all of this on time. Check out our cover crop page on the Hoss Tools website to answer more of your questions!\n\nWatch the video below to see Greg continue to explain the benefits of cover crops and the nutrients it brings your soil!!!\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UJn8n3f3N8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  &amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=16",

    "body_html": "<h2>How-To Scratch Potatoes</h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scratching is a southern term used in gardening, meaning digging up a few of your potatoes early. This blog is going to explain how-to scratch potatoes and help you enjoy your garden before that ten weeks maturity period is up.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Potatoes have a long maturity period, and at times we can get a little impatient, and that's what leads us to scratch our potatoes. You want to make sure not to scratch too early, or the potatoes you dig up will be duds. We all want to enjoy our garden grown groceries, but sometimes it is just too hard to wait!! If it is almost harvest time, though, and you are craving some of those homemade mashed potatoes, then this should do the trick.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If your potatoes are dry, wherever you see a crack, you want to follow it down, easing your fingers until you feel a potato. Then you are going to ease it up, out of the ground. You want to make sure you are careful not to damage the plant and that you feel around to grab one of the bigger potatoes. If you scratch the right way, your potato plant will never even know! </span>\n<h2>Walk Around the Garden</h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As our spring garden is starting to be in full bloom, we take a walk around to see what is producing the best this year—highlighting some of our best varieties around our spring garden. </span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The first thing that we notice is the </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/rattlesnake-pole-bean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rattlesnake Pole Beans</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, growing to be one of the tallest in our garden and also one of the prettiest because of their pretty purple bloom. These Rattlesnake Pole Beans are an heirloom variety and can grow to be around ten feet tall. Though we often say our hybrid varieties produce more crop, that isn't necessarily the case with this bean. The Rattlesnake Pole bean gets harvested very often, producing pods that are six to seven inches long. This bean does well in our climate because of our hot and humid temperatures. </span>\n\n<a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/blue-bayou-pumpkin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Blue Bayou Winter Squash</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is something new in the garden that we were very excited to grow. This pumpkin is a hybrid variety with an heirloom look that also offers downy and powdery mildew resistance. Though it grows like our summer squash varieties, it is a winter squash that has about a 90-day maturity rate. After 90 days, the crop should be around 15-20 pounds.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Only standing about six inches tall, our </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jambalaya Okra</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is starting to bloom and already becoming very productive; it won't be much longer until they are ready to harvest. The Jambalaya Okra plant will produce heavy yields of green pods that are great for pickling, frying, and stewing. </span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now, in an area that we didn't have many plans for, we decided to use an attractive option for a cover crop, The ProCut Plum Sunflower. This flower is a single stalk sunflower that is pollen-less yet still gives off a massive bloom. The ProCut sunflower is incredible for drawing in your pollinators to help your other plants with production.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The last thing in our garden is one of Greg's favorite crops, watermelon. He decided to grow an old heirloom variety called Moon and Stars that his granddaddy grew to see how it compares to the new hybrids. Greg noticed something weird with the foliage once they started to come up out of the ground; it had yellow spots on it. He hasn't quite figured out the spacing on what works best, but their yellow flower bloom is starting to come up nicely. </span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Click on the Video Below to see this garden in action or to learn more on Gardening with Greg!!</span>\n\n \n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmJlHh6DQCc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST-Yk4gi92_SVoPJVNqxm_3h&amp;index=17",

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tips to Help the Beginner Gardener</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Summer squash is the first thing to pop up in your spring garden with an only 55-60 day maturity rate; these few tips will help take your summer squash to the next level. With all plants, you have to find the seed that is right for you, at Hoss Tools we enjoy using the hybrid varieties as they boost in production. Hybrid means that the seeds get cross-pollinated, not that they are a GMO. You also have to decide if you want to plant a crookneck or straight neck squash.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are always choices in gardening, and when you get ready to plant, you are faced with the decision to direct seed or to transplant. Transplanting can be very beneficial with many crops, but with squash, we have seen that direct seeding does better as they germinate quickly. When you are direct seeding, you want to make sure you plant every twelve inches apart to ensure adequate spacing. Squash spreads out across the plot, so you want to make sure they are not all over each other.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To be able to take care of your squash, you need to understand the importance of pollination. Summer Squash has two blooms, the higher one is the male bloom, and the lower one with the flower is the female bloom. The bee first goes to the male bloom and then to the female to pollinate. If you do not have pollinators present in your garden, you will either have no fruit or a very misshaped squash. Once the flower falls off, that usually is a tell-tell sign that your squash is ready to be picked.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Squash is a plant that has to be harvested every two to three days once they start to pop up. We suggest that you pick them on the smaller size as that is when they are nice and tender. If you let the fruits grow to large, that leaves them open to more disease and pests and can make them unpalatable.

    "body_html": "<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is a Cover Crop?</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the most basic definition, a cover crop is a plant that covers the soil while you are not using it. Growing a cover crop is going to lead to healthier soil and a more productive garden. Because of its many benefits, some farmers/gardeners like to mix two cover crops in a field and call it a cover crop cocktail. Whether you are using just one crop or a cocktail, it is crucial for your soil and the future of your crops.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many cover crops, with each one having different benefits for your soil, for example, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/hairy-vetch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hairy Vetch</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Hairy Vetch is a cool-season crop as well as a legume, meaning that it stores up nitrogen and phosphorous in its roots, so it helps make the soil rich for your next crop. Another example is </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/winter-rye/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rye</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which is also a cool-season crop, and it is a cereal grain. Rye works well in soils where erosion and weeds are a problem because it helps fight both of those. These two cover crops, Rye and Hairy Vetch work well together because they differ in what they do. Planting these two as a cocktail will help keep your soil flat with no weeds and continue to stay rich in minerals underneath.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In South Georgia, specifically, we push our soil almost all times of the year, we can do this because of our weather conditions. We have to keep up with our crop rotation and understand the importance of taking care of our soil. That is why it is so imperative to plan out what you will be planting and where each crop will be at so you can know what cover crops will benefit your land the most. Planning is essential in every stage of gardening to get the most out of your crops.</span>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cool Season Types of Cover Crops</span></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/broadleaf-mustard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Broadleaf Mustard</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/austrian-winter-pea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Austrian Winter Pea</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/crimson-clover/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crimson Clover</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/tillage-radish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tillage Radish</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Warm Season Types of Cover Crops</span></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brown Top Millet</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Buckwheat</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/buckwheat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sunn Hemp</span></a></li>\n \t<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sorghum Sudangrass</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What do I do Now?</span></h2>\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once you have figured out what cover crop seed will work best for your soil, and you know where and what will be going in the garden after the cover crop, then you go in there and direct seed them into the same plot. If you decide to do the cocktail of two crops, you can plant the two seeds at the same time and then rake them in together. This mixing will help spread the benefits of both crops across the plot.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Next, you are going to leave your cover crops growing until right before they start to seed. You will know they are beginning to germinate once you see it forming. When they are about to drop the seed, that means it is time to work that cover crop back in. If you have a flail mower, you can cut it down, and it will incorporate the crops back in but no worries if you do not you can do it with a regular lawnmower as well.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before it is time for you to plant your garden, you are going to cut it down and till it all in together as you plant your garden and watch it grow to pay attention to how your garden benefited before and after using a cover crop. Hopefully, your garden will be the most fruitful it has ever been.</span>\n\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Check out our cover crops seed page to see a break down of all the crops, if you are still on the fence about planting them check out the video below!</span>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcBAsy05T30\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;t=41s",

    "title": "Installing a Drip Tape Irrigation System for the Vegetable Garden",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:54-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Best Way to Irrigate the Garden</h2>\nThe most effective way to maximize garden production is by using drip tape irrigation that will be applied to plant roots and you can use <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">water-soluble fertilizers</a> directly through the drip to supply plants better with needed nutrients. Most people believe that drip tape can be used either on top or buried in the soil. However, drip tape was really made to go underneath the soil in the garden. This allows the irrigation tape to stay in place, decrease disease pressure, and reduce damage caused by natural causes. It also provides plenty of needed nutrients for plant growth and healthier plants in the vegetable garden. Not only does it apply equal amounts of irrigation to the plants, but it conserves water by going directly to the plant roots in the vegetable garden, unlike overhead irrigation systems.\n<h2>Simplest Way to Install Drip Tape</h2>\nThe first component to setting up the drip tape irrigation in the garden is to layout the <a href=\"/products/mainline-tubing/\">mainline tubing</a> which will help distribute water to each drip line effectively along the desired rows. Then, to feed the mainline tubing we use a <a href=\"/products/filter-regulator-combo/\">filter regulator combo</a> which has a filter to trap any particulate material from entering the tape and the pressure regulator that reduces the pressure of water entering the low-pressure drip tape system. We recommend placing this filter regulator in the middle of the drip tape irrigation to ensure you get equal amounts of water distributed along each row in the garden. The next step is to bury the drip tape for a couple of different reasons. The first reason is during the hotter months your surface evaporation is going to greatly reduce meaning your plants will be able to use more of the water that is being put out if you have buried drip irrigation. Another reason to bury the tape is to simply just get it out of the way so you don't have to move it around every time you cultivate the soil. When it comes burying drip tape the best tool to use is our <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">Drip Tape Layer</a> attachment. When hooking up the row starts and row ends this will complete the setup of the drip system. The <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-start/\">row start</a> is designed to connect the drip tape along the rows to the mainline tubing and the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-row-end/\">row ends</a> are the easiest way to seal the end of the tape. Overall, we recommend using drip tape to ensure you supply your plants with the needed nutrients and irrigation directly to the roots throughout the growing season.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"&lt;div%20class=\" video-container>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SGkY2FYbdaI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </iframe>\n</div>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;\n  ",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:53-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Planting Fall Transplants</h2>\nIn the 30 by 35 garden plot, Travis has 11 rows that are ready for fall transplants. To prepare the garden for fall planting, he had to first clean the area from any previous crops. The next step is to add in some chicken manure and till it in to help improve the structure or tilth of the soil. Instead of adding in a new drip tape manifold, Travis saved the previous setup to use again for fall transplants. Then, he added in furrows by using the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the plow set attachment in the furrowing position in order to push soil outward and create a nice little furrow for the drip tape to be laid in. Once the vegetable garden is set up perfectly for fall planting it's now time to plant the transplants from the greenhouse. The first two crops that he is going to plant several rows of are the Tiger Collards and <a href=\"/products/lacinato-kale/\">Lacinato Kale</a> which are very productive producers in the vegetable garden. Then, in the remainder of the plot, he is going to plant some <a href=\"/products/green-magic-broccoli/\">Green Magic Broccoli</a> which is a nice heat-tolerant variety as well as, some <a href=\"/products/snow-bowl-cauliflower/\">Snow Bowl Cauliflower</a> which is another excellent crop to plant in the fall. The best way to plant the transplants in the garden is by walking along the rows and drop a plant by every water spot from the drip tape. Then, once the majority of the rows have plants Travis will get on his knees and scoot along the rows to plant the transplants in the garden soil.\n<h2>Transplanting vs. Direct Seeding</h2>\nWhen it comes to transplanting or direct-seeding it is simply up to the gardener which method they prefer in their vegetable garden. However, there are benefits to both methods, and some crops do better transplanted while others do better direct-seeded. Transplants offer bountiful benefits when it comes to growing vegetables in the garden. Not only do you get to control when you plant seedlings but you also get better germination rates which will produce healthier growing plants. Another example, for transplanting instead of direct seeding is if you have warmer weather vegetables that you would like to get a headstart on growing this allows you to prepare those vegetables before the growing season starts. Therefore, when the growing season begins and weather conditions are ideal you already have germinated plants that are ready to go in the soil in the fall garden. Transplanting also reduces weed pressures due to them having limited time in the garden area. Since the transplants are already germinated they provide a stronger immune to weeds that will have a little amount of time to germinate in the garden. Another benefit is improved and faster crop turnaround. By starting the vegetables in transplants it can speed up the amount of time it takes them to germinate meaning less time in the garden area. With less time in the garden, more production is harvested and it allows for another crop to be planted in the same spot. Overall, transplanting allows for healthier and more productive vegetables while saving us time, money, and energy in the garden.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lM3IabKtdRc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=6&amp;t=203s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Quality Manure</h2>\nThere are several benefits to adding quality grade manure to create bountiful vegetable garden soils. Some of these benefits include increasing the productivity of crops, improved growth, and overall healthier plants in the area. By adding the best soil amendment it will leave your soil structure with increased benefits that are ideal for future growing seasons. Using great compost contains four key components — organic matter, moisture, bacteria, and oxygen. The organic matter provides the needed nitrogen and carbon sources for plant growth. While the moisture allows the compost to not dry out and the oxygen supports the breakdown of plant material. Then, the other microorganisms like bacteria will break down all the components and plant material into the useful compost material needed for the vegetable garden. When incorporating the compost in sandy soils it can increase the water-holding capacity, while in the heavier clay soils it can improve drainage. Another advantage of adding compost to the soil is the decrease in using lots of fertilizer in the area.\n<h2>Bountiful Vegetable Garden</h2>\nOne of the most important factors to growing a bountiful vegetable garden is adding a quality grade chicken manure compost. Travis picked up some excellent manure compost that is relatively dry and broken down which will spread in the garden effectively and till into the soil well. This compost is ideal for the fall garden when getting ready to plant some heavy feeder crops like cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. As mentioned early we won't have to add as much liquid or granular fertilizer because the compost will feed the soil pretty well. Travis has already prepared the first 2 plots that he is going to plant in for the fall garden. After broadcasting the compost on the two plots it's now time to till in the garden in order to incorporate it into the soil. Most of the time we do the fad system in the garden which means furrow, amend, and <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip</a>. Instead of using the fad system and applying compost only in the furrow where plants are going to be planted we make an exception and broadcast the compost throughout the vegetable garden. Since this is a new garden area it will need a little more help when it comes to amending and conditioning the entire plot to make the soil more workable and increase nutrients throughout the plot. Another factor to remember is that fall crops will be planted close together so you might as well compost the entire area because it really won't affect the vegetables negatively if you broadcast it throughout the vegetable garden plot.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgbBdGp2R3Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=7&amp;t=188s",

When losing plants in the garden it doesn't mean you should give up or quit taking chances when growing plants. Gardening is a variable thing because we have no control over weather temperatures or conditions that may happen throughout the growing season. Sometimes we plant as soon as we think we can plant a certain crop and it can work out wonderful or fail other times in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Why Are We Losing Plants?</h2>\nIn the past, we have planted <a href=\"/products/kentucky-blue-pole-bean/\">Kentucky Blue Pole Beans</a> around early September to late August to get a headstart on germination before the cool weather comes through. However, this season the weather has not cooperated like normal, and it has turned out hotter than usual. With hotter temperatures, we have experienced a decline in production while also losing plants in the vegetable garden. Our pole beans started off with really good germination, and everything was growing fine until the hot temperatures began to stay around longer than expected. Although a few of the plants thrived a bunch of them look pitiful and have experienced disease pressure problems.\n<h2>Winning in the Vegetable Garden</h2>\nAlthough we may be losing plants we are also winning with a few plants in the garden. On the same day of planting pole beans, we also planted a row of <a href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\">Stonewall Cucumbers</a>. We have gave both crops the same amount of treatment but the cucumbers seem to be thriving better than the pole beans. This variety of cucumbers is gynoecious which means they produce predominantly female flowers. These cucumbers have a few white specks on the leaves that indicate insect issues that will need to be dealt with which whitefly eggs. To help control these insect pressures we will start a spray program using <a href=\"/products/horticultural-oil/\">Horticultural Oil</a> for whiteflies and <a href=\"/products/monterey-b-t/\">B.t.</a> to take care of pickle worms. By growing on a <a href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-48-x-50/\">Hortonova</a> trellis we are able to keep plants off the ground and provide a strong structure to climb. These cucumbers continue to produce and we are excited about getting a bountiful crop this year.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EVIcI2eo-bw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=8&amp;t=0s",

Corn is a self-pollinating plant that produces a male flower, which is commonly referred to as a tassel, and a female flower, which is commonly referred to as the silks. In order for kernels of corn to be produced by the plant, the male flowers must pollinate the female flowers. The male flower is located at the very top of the plant whereas the female flower is formed along the stalk of the plant. The male flower contains the pollen, which is primarily spread by wind, that will be used to pollinate the female plant in the garden. Another major factor of planting sweet corn is it needs plenty of <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-irrigation-kit/\">drip irrigation</a> to grow throughout the growing season. Since corn is a heavy feeder it needs plenty of water and fertilizer to get healthy producing plants in the vegetable garden. We suggest using <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> around four times throughout the growing season. The garden previously had a <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\">silage tarp</a> over the area to help improve the garden soils before planting fall sweet corn. Once the tarp was removed we used the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set attachment</a> to create furrows where our desired rows would be and a place to bury the drip tape.\n<h2>Hilling and Side Dressing</h2>\nIn the garden, we have seven rows of <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\">Peaches and Cream Sweet Corn</a> that is around a foot or a little over in height and is ready to be hilled. The hilling process basically means we will throw soil on top of the bottom structure of plants in order to provide a strong base stalk, kill off germinating weeds, and help retain soil moisture. However, before we hill sweet corn we need to side-dress alongside the stalks. By side-dressing, we are able to add a good quality granular fertilizer which helps add a slow-release action to the corn plants. We recommend using a side-dress fertilizer such as <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a> and the general rule of thumb is to put around ten pounds per thousand square feet of corn. When side-dressing the fertilizer you need to place it close enough to the plants for the plow set to cover and bury it but not so close that it burns the plant. When going to hill the corn plants we suggest using the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> which allows us to go along the row of plants and easily hill in one pass through. Another advantage of using the high arch is you can adjust the distance between the wheels to either narrow or wider hilling position. Overall, hilling and side dressing fall sweet corn allow us to make our garden rows more manageable and increase our production in the vegetable garden.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHTjWBdIh50\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=9&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:51-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Cover Cropping Garden Soils</h2>\nThe main benefit of cover cropping the garden is the many beneficial nutrients that they can incorporate into the soils. Not only can they improve your garden soils but they can also control weeds, increase yields, and reduce soil erosion. Cover cropping soil also allows you to plant year-round keeping your garden manageable and workable for future growing seasons. When picking the right cover crop for your area keep in mind what your soil needs to improve on for the next growing season. As with all cover crops, remember they should be cut or mowed down before going to seed in order to prevent reseeding issues in the future.\n<h2>Planting Sorghum Sudangrass</h2>\nWhen planting a warm-season cover crop such as <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a> this is a fast producing crop that quickly outpaces the growth of competing weeds. Some of the benefits that sudangrass adds into the soil is outstanding \"green manure\" that adds a significant amount of organic matter to increase soil health and tilth once incorporated into the garden soil. Also, with the addition of organic matter through cover cropping, we are able to suppress nematode populations. The ideal time to plant sudangrass is once soils reach around 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit and can be broadcasted or planted with a planter like our <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. Although it can be planted in the Spring we recommend using it as a transition crop between Spring and Fall crops to get the best results. Currently, in the garden, we had a nice thick stand of sudangrass vegetation that we laid or crimped in the area. Once the area was crimped then we laid a <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\">silage tarp</a> over top to help kill off all the vegetation. After a couple of weeks of the tarp being on the area, it is now time to remove it to see how the soil is doing in the garden spot. The tarp did an excellent job of killing off all the vegetation and we are able to see just how great the cover crop was broken down throughout the area. Now, it's time to add some good quality compost that we can broadcast all throughout the soil and then either re-tarp it or till it until we are ready to plant in the area again.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/30c45b7V5-A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=10&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:50-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Germinating Garden Seeds</h2>\nIn the greenhouse, we currently have a lot of garden seeds that are being germinated for fall transplanting. In the first <a href=\"/products/seed-starting-trays/\">seed starting tray</a>, we have the Savannah Sweet onion variety that has a few seed germinating but not a full tray. In the next tray, there are four lettuce varieties such as <a href=\"/products/cherokee-lettuce/\">Cherokee</a>, <a href=\"/products/butter-crunch-lettuce/\">Butter Crunch</a>, <a href=\"/products/skyphos-butterhead-lettuce/\">Skyphos</a>, and <a href=\"/products/calshot-romaine-lettuce/\">Calshot</a> that have just been added to the greenhouse so no germination quite yet on those. In the third tray, we have <a href=\"/products/calendula-prince-mix/\">Calendula</a> which is a cool flower that produces colorful blend of yellow and orange blooms. The two varieties of beets that are growing are <a href=\"/products/kestrel-beet/\">Kestral</a> and <a href=\"/products/early-wonder-beet/\">Early Wonder</a> which are both excellent beet varieties. The fifth seed starting tray has some <a href=\"/products/matejko-leek/\">Matejko</a> leeks which is a hybrid variety of leek that has really good germination right now in the greenhouse. Then in the last few trays, we have some <a href=\"/products/cheers-cabbage/\">Cheers Cabbage</a>, <a href=\"/products/charleston-wakefield-cabbage/\">Charleston Wakefield</a>, and <a href=\"/products/rio-grande-red-cabbage/\">Rio Grande Cabbage</a>. Along the other side of the greenhouse, there is a tray of <a href=\"/products/southern-giant-curled-mustard/\">Southern Giant Curled Mustard</a> which can be direct seeded into the garden, but Travis decided to try transplanting for this growing season. The next tray is some <a href=\"/products/scarlet-kale/\">Scarlet Kale</a> which is an open-pollinated variety that produces deep red plants. Beside the kale flat, is some nice germinated <a href=\"/products/touchstone-gold-beet/\">Touchstone Gold Beets</a> which are multigerm so each seed will give you two to three little sprouts. Then, two flats of <a href=\"/products/green-magic-broccoli/\">Green Magic Broccoli</a> and two different varieties of cauliflower which are <a href=\"/products/snow-bowl-cauliflower/\">Snow Bowl</a> and Purple Cauliflower. Next, in the greenhouse is a flat of <a href=\"/products/jade-cross-brussels-sprouts/\">Jade Cross Brussel Sprouts</a> and a flat of <a href=\"/products/red-bull-brussels-sprouts/\">Red Bull</a>. While in the last two flats that are currently growing is the famous Tiger Collards that is one of the most productive crops you can grow in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Three Factors to Why Seeds Are Not Germinating</h2>\nWithin the greenhouse, there are three factors that can help determine why your garden seeds may not be growing. The first factor that is important for germination is moisture. The seed starting mix that we use is <a href=\"/products/pro-mix-organic-seed-starting-mix/\">Pro-Mix</a> which is a quality grade mix that promotes excellent root development. For water to drain really well through the tray, you must soak the soil to ensure you are watering throughout the entire seed starting tray. The second factor that is important is heat during the fall this really isn't an issue because of our weather temperatures in the South. However, during the spring, we have to use a heat map that will give the soil the desired optimal germination temperature. Typically the garden soil needs to be around 75 degrees to germinate well. While the third biggest factor in why you may experience bad germination is poor quality seeds. If you buy cheap seeds more than likely, you will receive poor germination. However, here at Hoss, we believe in excellent germination rates and high-quality garden seeds. We test our seeds every six to nine months to ensure you are getting fresh seeds with excellent germination rates when you order from us.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOd0iYykAxI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=11&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:50-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Factors of Planting Sweet Corn</h2>\nThe three most important factors when growing the best sweet corn are pollination, irrigation, and fertilization. When it comes to planting our Peaches and Cream sweet corn it should be planted in blocks or squares because corn is pollinated by the wind, therefore planting in blocks instead of long rows ensures that once the crop starts tasselling the wind can effectively pollinate the sweet corn. Since corn is a self-pollinating plant that produces a male flower, which is commonly referred to as a tassel, and a female flower, which is commonly referred to as the silks.

The male flower contains the pollen, which is primarily spread by the wind and that will be used to pollinate the female plant located on the stalk of the plant. Another major factor of growing sweet corn is it needs plenty of irrigation to grow in the garden. We recommend using drip tape because it ensures all the water is going directly to the plant roots where they need it the most in the vegetable garden. Also, corn is a heavy feeder that needs plenty of fertilizer to grow healthy producing plants. Before planting the corn, we recommend at pre-plant to add a good amount of compost down in the garden soil. Then, once the corn gets around knee-high, you can start fertilizing using a fertilizer injector through the drip system. We recommend injecting <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> fertilizer and <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a> which both add the needed nutrients for healthy and productive sweet corn plants.\n<h2>Growing Peaches and Cream</h2>\nAs we prepare to plant our fall corn variety, <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\">Peaches and Cream Sweet Corn</a> is our go-to variety this growing season. This variety is a se or sugary extender type of sweet corn which means it matures a little quicker than some of the other standard varieties. Peaches and Cream is a bicolor that produces yellow and white kernels on the same cob and tends to have a little sweet flavor profile. Before we begin planting sweet corn we have to ensure our seed plates for the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a> are calibrated correctly and runs freely through the seeder. To prepare the garden for planting we will incorporate the F.A.D system which means furrow, amend, and drip. Using the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a>, we are able to add a small furrow within the garden that provides a space to plant the sweet corn. Then, we will amend the soil within that furrow we created and add drip tape for better irrigation. By planting seven rows of sweet corn we are able to get as much production as possible in the garden area. The maturity date on the Peaches and Cream sweet corn is around 80 days, however, with warmer temperatures in the growing cycle, we will be able to harvest the corn around 65 to 70 days. There are several great sweet corn varieties that we have available, but we are excited to try the Peaches and Cream in the Fall vegetable garden this year.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYqbmTnc9LI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=12&amp;t=0s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:49-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>What is No-Till?</h2>\nThe meaning behind no-till gardening is the process of turning over around 6 to 10 inches of soil that will loosen and remove any plant matter for planting new crops in the area. While tilling sounds ideal it can actually harm the soil by striping the rich organic matter and insects that form healthy soil biology. Therefore, by using the no-till technique we are able to leave the garden soil intact and improve the soil using better practices such as cover crops and <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-30-x-40/\">silage tarping</a> the area.\n<h2>Growing Corn in the Garden</h2>\nCurrently, in the garden, we have a silage tarp that has been on our future fall corn plot for about six weeks and is ready to be removed for planting. Once the tarp is removed we are able to see the nice soil that is ready to be worked and prepared for fall planting. To begin preparing the garden for growing corn we need to start with the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set</a> attachment to help us make furrows for laying drip tape in the garden. We recommend using the <a href=\"/products/drip-tape-layer-attachment/\">drip tape layer</a> attachment to easily bury and effectively lay drip tape in straight rows. Now that we have seven rows ready to plant fall corn we will start with the <a href=\"/products/peaches-and-cream-sweet-corn/\">Peaches and Cream</a> variety. This sweet corn variety is a hybrid bicolor that is known for being a sugary extender which means it can store longer than standard varieties once harvested. By using a cover crop and silage tarp to increase the nutrients the overall cultivation is minimal. Another factor of planting corn is the crop is wind-pollinated which means you always want to plant in a square plot for better pollination. Therefore, wind pollination allows the tassels to start forming on the tops of the male flowers where the pollen will begin to pollinate the female flowers on the ears or silks of the corn. Another major factor of growing corn is it needs plenty of irrigation to grow in the garden. We recommend using drip tape because it ensures all the water is going directly to the plant roots where they need it the most to grow in the vegetable garden. Also, since corn is a heavy feeder it needs plenty of fertilizer to grow healthy plants. Some fertilization products like <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> or <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a> are great for feeding the plants. While using <a href=\"/products/spinosad-garden-insect-spray/\">Spinosad Insect Spray</a> is great for controlling worm pressure which is important when corn starts tasseling in the garden. When growing the best sweet corn these three important factors such as pollination, irrigation, and fertilization can all ensure that you produce the most productive and healthiest sweet corn in the vegetable garden all throughout the growing season.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BANbkbfRxbU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=13&amp;t=0s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Preparing Healthy Garden Soils</h2>\nThere are many aspects that factor into getting healthy garden soils in your desired planting area. When starting out the best way to see what type of pH level you have in your soil is by testing to see what nutrients need to be added and what does not. Another factor in achieving healthy garden soils is by adding organic matter to help improve the structure or tilth of the soil in the ground. Also, by incorporating a good quality compost we can increase the water, air, and nutrients that the plants need in the vegetable garden. In addition, adding cover crops after you harvest a crop can help bring nutrients back into the soil before planting a new crop for the next growing season. By preparing the soils to best of our ability we are able to improve our nutrients, production, and overall ability to grow healthy plants.\n<h2>Getting the Garden Ready for Fall Planting</h2>\nSince planting pole beans and cucumbers for the fall garden they have started to come up and get really good germination. Now it's time to get some other plots ready for some cool weather crops in the next few weeks. We'll be starting transplants in the greenhouse, therefore the plots need to be ready once the transplants are ready to be planted. There are a couple of plots in the garden that have cover crops that need to be extinguished so we get those areas ready for fall planting. Currently, we have a dense crop of <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a> that is starting to go to seed so we need to take care of it before it goes any further in the garden. Travis is going to try something new like crimping the sudangrass which means he is going to lay it down using the riding lawnmower with the deck laid down as low as it will go in order to run over the cover crop and fold it over in the area. Once it is folded over or laid down he will take the <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-30-x-40/\">silage tarp</a> to help kill all the vegetation in the garden plot. When the tarp is laid down the plan is to let the sorghum die down which should take around two weeks and then remove the tarp in order to add compost and lightly till it in the soil. During the tilling process, a few weed seeds will probably pop up so we will put the tarp back on the area for another couple of weeks to kill any of the weed seeds that are in the garden soil. Then, when you pull the tarp off for the second time around four to five weeks when it's time to transplant the healthy garden soils should be ideal for fall planting. Now in the <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> plot, the cover crop is going to seed and needs to be taken care of before it continues seeding. Travis is going to add the silage tarp on this plot but there is a different plan before tarping the area. Since this cover crop only got around knee-high we are able to just mow it down with the push mower that has a mulching deck that won't blow it around and will leave it right in the area. Once the millet is mowed down now it's time to tarp the area to allow the green manure to decompose nicely into the soil and ready for fall planting. When dealing with cover crops they don't require a lot of equipment to maintain and build up the soils. Therefore, cover crops are ideal for preparing garden soils with little to no hassle.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCm4GMP0dPU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=14&amp;t=223s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Preparing for Fall Planting</h2>\nWhen getting ready for a busy fall planting it's important to prepare the garden soil to the best of your ability before the future growing season. By using good compost manure to replenish the vegetable garden soil with the needed nutrients for crops you are able to ensure the soil is ready for fall planting.\n<h2>Currently in the Vegetable Garden</h2>\nTravis currently has his garden broken into 10 subplots to help make a better rotation of crops and manage the gardens better. In the first subplot, he has a warm-season cover crop <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a> that provides excellent ground coverage throughout the garden. Instead of chopping it up and laying it on the soil, Travis is thinking about crimping it then using the <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\">silage tarp</a> to cover it up. On the second subplot, he has a nice stand of jambalaya okra but they are not producing okra pods because we might be giving them to much fertilizer. When growing okra you have to be careful not to give them to much fertilizer, otherwise, you will get all vegetation and not a lot of okra production. On the third plot, we have four rows of peppers and two rows of eggplant throughout the garden area. They are supported using the Florida weave technique and are producing well in the heat as we continue to give them plenty of irrigation and fertilizer them about every two weeks. The two different eggplant varieties that are growing are <a href=\"/products/purple-shine-eggplant/\">Purple Shine</a> and Striped Italian Eggplant. Then, as far as pepper growing we have a variety of hot and sweet varieties. Next, in plot number four we have tomatoes planted from the spring and took the advice from our viewers to use wheat straw mulch around the plants and till it into the soil to help add organic matter. Since planting tomatoes, Travis has come in the area and planted a cover crop of <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a> that has been growing fast and will help add nitrogen to restore the soils for fall planting in the area. In two more subplots of the vegetable garden, there are <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Millet</a> and <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a> cover crops planted to help prepare the plots for fall planting. Then, in plot number seven this is the oldest plot we have in the dream garden and we have more okra growing that's around seven to eight-foot-tall. Instead of pulling the okra plants, Travis has decided to take his loppers and cut it clean to the soil so he can leave the root structure there and just cover crop on top of it. In a couple of other subplots in the vegetable garden is <a href=\"/products/lacinato-kale/\">Lacinato Kale</a> that is ready to harvest and <a href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\">Stonewall Cucumbers</a> that did really well but ready to be cleaned from the area as well. Also, some flowers that were used to bring in pollinators in the area will just be mowed down before planting another cover crop to help prepare for fall planting even more. In plot number nine, Travis has an entire plot of Georgia Jet potatoes that has created a great dense mat of vegetation that will help prevent a lot of weed growth and allow the potatoes to thrive in the area. In the last plot of the dream garden, there is a crop of Tiger Collards that are still producing and two more rows of transplanted jambalaya okra to hopefully make up for the other okra that is not producing. Once the Tiger Collards are done producing he hopes to plant pole beans and maybe a fall crop of cucumbers in the entire plot.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JLw_atiM-E\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>&amp;amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;amp;index=14",

    "body_html": "<h2>Summer Planting</h2>\nIt is around the peak of warm temperatures for the summer growing season this year. With this kind of warm weather conditions, there's not a lot of vegetable crops that will produce in the garden area. However, some crops like okra, sweet potatoes, and zinnias can continue to grow in these temperatures. This is why we recommend building up your soils during the summer to prepare them for planting in the fall. Using a summer cover crop is not only great for shorter growing windows but you also maintain the garden and improve the soil tilth in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Summer Cover Crop</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is planting a beneficial summer cover crop to help build up the garden soils. He currently has two subplots in the dream garden that he is going to plant Buckwheat and Brown Top Millet. Before planting the summer cover crop, Travis used the tiller to help get the soil nice and fluffy to ensure the area gets good seed to soil and better germination in the vegetable garden. The <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a> is perfect for smaller growing windows because it grows very fast compared to other cover crop varieties. It also breaks down quickly in the garden which will allow for faster turnover and replanting of vegetables in the following growing season. Buckwheat is ideal for maintaining weed suppression since it grows so fast it is able to outpace the growth of weeds, therefore, making it easier to control. Another benefit of this cover crop is it provides a significant amount of organic matter that will loosen and improve the topsoil this ensures the garden soil will be more workable and increase soil drainage in the area. The <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> is an excellent cover crop for livestock forage and green manure for adding organic matter to the soils. Typically millet is a tall, bunching grass that can reach up to 12 feet high which adds a \"mat\" over the soil that provides complete ground cover in the vegetable garden. The millet cover crop is also ideal for soils that have low moisture and low fertility with areas in high temperatures. Some of the benefits of planting millet is it can add significant amounts of organic matter to depleted soils which can improve soil tilth and quality. Travis recommends planting these two cover crop varieties with a precision planter like the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. With our seed plate design, you are able to customize the plates according to what seed varieties you are planting in the vegetable garden. Like all cover crops, they should be mowed or cut in order to incorporate back into the soil before going to seed. By incorporating them back into soils you will ensure that all nutrients is getting added into the garden soil and preventing weed issues in the future.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOiwJq9ZjAo&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=17&amp;t=18s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Difference Between Fertilized vs. Unfertilized Plants</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is showing the difference between fertilized vs. unfertilized plants in the vegetable garden. When discussing whether you should fertilize plants or not, it has been experimentally proven that we need to fertilize plants in order to successfully grow crops. Fertilization plays a major role that can alter a lot of factors when planting and growing vegetables in the garden area.\n<h2>Comparing Fertilization Plants</h2>\nTravis some evidence on why fertilizing plants in the garden is needed to have a successful growing season. He currently has around a 40-foot row of <a href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\">Stonewall Cucumber</a> plants that has been able to continue production well into the late summer months. Not only is harvesting solid cucumbers but overall the plants are healthy with vegetation, leaves, and vegetables to show from the fertilization they have received. Across the garden on another plot, Travis has planted the same cucumbers that have experienced the same amount of irrigation but he left them as unfertilized plants. These unfertilized plants are having a harder time with production and not nearly as successful as the fertilized plants. When comparing the leaves between the two plants the fertilized plant has dark green leaves that are as big as a lily pad. While the unfertilized plant has yellowish leaves that seem to be experiencing a nutrient deficiency. With the fertilized cucumbers we are able to use our <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">EZ-Flo Injector</a> to not only supply enough irrigation but fertilizer as well directly to the plant roots. Travis recommends fertilizing the plants by mixing <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> and <a href=\"/products/micro-boost/\">Micro Boost</a> into the injector. He suggests using about two pounds of the 20-20-20 and two cups of the micro boost to supply enough fertilizer to the cucumber plants. Whether you should fertilizer your plants or not all depends on your soil type conditions in the vegetable garden. Here in the South, we have sandy soils that are great for growing in because it's easy to work in and plant in. However, the downside of having sandy soils is it doesn't hold nutrients well which is very important for growing vegetables. If you have clay soils you don't have any problems with holding nutrients, therefore, it's not necessary for you to have frequent fertilization in the garden. Although for sandy soils we must fertilize our plants often to ensure we obtain enough nutrients to make healthy producing crops. Overall, to understand whether or not you should fertilizer, you should determine what soil type you have to help you grow the best vegetables you can in the garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5WanB5LkIU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=16&amp;t=0s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Cover Cropping with Sunn Hemp</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis and Greg have a patch of <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a> which is a warm-season cover crop in the vegetable garden. This cover crop variety is a legume which means it is related to crops like beans, peas, peanuts, and hairy vetch. This is a beneficial cover crop that allows you to add a significant amount of nitrogen, suppress weeds, and quality organic matter back into the garden soils. However, compared to other warm-season varieties the Sunn Hemp is the only nitrogen fixer cover crop. As a nitrogen fixer, it is able to grab nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into your garden soil. This fixer is important in the garden because when you get rid of the cover crop you will gain lots of available nitrogen for the next vegetable crop you plant in that area. Some recent studies have shown that Sunn Hemp can fix up to 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre which is excellent when planting heavy feeder crops like onions and corn. Sunn Hemp should be planted when soil temperatures are around 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When planting it can be broadcasted or with a precision planter like the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. It ultimately grows extremely fast and typically reaches maturity in 8 to 12 weeks. This cover crop variety is pretty much maintenance-free and does not take a lot of effort to grow in the area. Since it grows so quickly it suppresses weed pressures by outpacing weed germination which is a major benefit in the vegetable garden. Like all cover crops, Sunn Hemp should be cut or mowed before it reaches seed to prevent reseeding issues in the future growing seasons. The guys mention that the best time to cut or mow it into the soils is during the woody stage.\n<h2>Benefit of Using Silage Tarps</h2>\nHowever, Travis is going to try to extinguish this cover crop in the garden using silage tarps. Before adding the silage tarp to the area, Greg will take his flair mower to mow down the cover crop. Once the Sunn Hemp is laid flat it is ready to add the new silage tarp on top. Depending on the size of your garden, we offer a <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-30-x-40/\">30' x 40'</a> and a <a href=\"/products/silage-tarp-40-x-50/\">40' x 50'</a> Silage Tarp. Using silage tarps as a garden technique is called occultation which essentially means that the tarp is blocking the sun from touching the soil. Therefore, the lack of sunlight penetrating the soil creates a warm, dark, moist environment in the vegetable garden. This environment facilitates the germination of weed seeds that quickly die due to the lack of sunlight. It also creates a dynamic soil life with abundant earthworm and beneficial bacterial populations. Another benefit of using silage tarps is when creating a new vegetable garden spot. The tarp can be used to kill existing grass and create a virtually weed-free garden area.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRFfOQ22G9Y&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=18&amp;t=220s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Cover Crops</h2>\nThe many benefits of growing cover crops are the increase of organic matter, nematode suppression, weed control, reduce soil erosion, and increase yields in the vegetable garden soils. When building up your garden soils you have to supply the best cover crop that fulfills the characteristics you are wanting to replenish in the soil.\n<h2>Repairing Vegetable Garden Soils</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is explaining the easiest way to repair vegetable garden soils. Currently growing is a nice patch of <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a> which is a warm-season cover crop that will provide a significant amount of biomass back into the soil. Since this cover crop is in the legume family it has the ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and transfer it in garden soils. Once it starts blooming, he will cut it down and place a silage tarp on top to help incorporate the nutrients back in the soil. Travis is going to plant another cover crop in the garden which is going to be <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>. This is a great addition to soils that have been heavily farmed or that have been depleted of nutrients and organic matter. Before adding the cover crop into the area, he first uses a tiller to make the soil more workable for planting. Since the seeds are uniform and round it makes easier to plant using the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a>. The seeder ensures accurate planting along rows without wasting seed by overplanting in the vegetable garden. Travis mentions that the recommended rate for sudangrass is one pound per thousand square feet. He is planting the warm season cover crop in an area that is 30 x 35 which is around the recommended rate. Travis is going to broadcast the seeds a little bit thicker in the area to ensure he gets a complete ground cover in the garden spot. Once the seeds are broadcasted he will take a <a href=\"/products/dura-rake-landscape-rake/\">landscape rake</a> and just drag it along the soil to ensure the seeds are nice and covered up in the area. Finally, he will add an overhead sprinkler to the area to get some water to the seeds and allow them to start growing in the vegetable garden soils.\n<h2>Beneficial Cover Crop Varieties</h2>\nTwo other beneficial warmers season cover crops are Buckwheat and Brown Top Millet. The <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a> variety is known for being fast-growing which allows for quick turnover in the vegetable garden. It can be squeezed in smaller windows such as spring and fall plantings when you want to break off pest and disease cycles to improve future plantings. When it comes to the <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> it can provide excellent ground cover that will work well for weed suppression in the vegetable garden soils. Another benefit of the millet is it can be used as livestock forage and green manure for adding organic matter which will improve soil tilth and quality back into the garden area.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdZIHMOUlo&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=19&amp;t=1s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:28-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Trellising Vegetables</h2>\nWhen it comes to trellising cucumbers, pole beans, or other vegetables there are several important reasons for doing this in the garden area. The first important reason for trellising plants is the ability to maximize space in smaller areas. For example, by trellising crops like pole beans you are able to plant on narrower rows that maximize production and productivity. The second reason behind trellising vegetables is the ability to add more stability to the growing plants. By adding additional stability to plants that are continuing to grow taller you are able to support the plants better and also increase productivity. Another important reason is the ability to monitor and control pests from trellised vegetables. When keeping plants off the ground and planted vertically we are able to control or reduce the amount of soil-borne diseases and other pests from taking over the vegetable garden. Overall, trellising vegetables can make harvesting much eaiser.\n<h2>New Trellis Netting</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is explaining the ideal way for trellising cucumbers, pole beans, and more vegetables. Previously in the garden, he has used 16 foot long galvanized cattle panels to trellis vegetables. However, the cattle panels are large which means they can take a long time to set up and are hard to move around the garden. This year, Travis is going to use the new <a href=\"/products/hortonova-trellis-netting-48-x-50/\">Hortonova Trellis Netting</a> which is what most commercial cucumber growers in the South use for growing. The synthetic mesh material can be used for trellising cucumbers and other vegetables either vertically or horizontally. To install vertically, use t-posts or wooden posts every 10-15 feet and to adequately secure the mesh to the stakes we use zip ties. To install horizontally, you can use 1 to 2-inch tall posts on the outside of the vegetable bed and simply stretch it across the posts to secure the mesh using zip ties. The trellis netting comes in many different sizes for all the various garden areas, but Travis just likes to get a big role and then cut it to the exact length he needs.\n<h2>Trellising Cucumbers</h2>\nTravis currently has a 40-foot row of cucumbers that are placed along the trellising netting. These cucumbers are just starting to climb the mesh netting in the garden area. Since cucumbers are a vining plant by establishing a stable structure like Hortonova netting we can ensure the plants will receive plenty of support throughout the growing process. In order to obtain a good stand of cucumber plants, we recommend planting seeds every 6 to 8 inches and thinning to one seed per foot in the garden spot. Overall, by trellising cucumbers not only can we maximize productivity but also reduce plant diseases by keeping them off the ground.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwKCshZwXuE&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=20&amp;t=140s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:26-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Importance of Attracting Pollinators</h2>\nThe reason behind attracting bees or other beneficial pollinators is the many different benefits they can provide the vegetable garden. The first benefit of attracting pollinators is the better production of plants. By transferring pollen from one flower to another flower can help plants produce healthy fruits. For crops that are self-pollinating such as corn, pollination is still very beneficial in order to help increase bountiful yields of crops for harvesting. The second advantage of attracting bees or beneficial insects is they help control pest pressures in the garden area. When pollinators are available in the garden not only are they transferring pollen but they are also eating unwanted insects that will overall reduce pest problems from the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Planting Flowers That Bees Love</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis has planted many different flower varieties that is helping when attracting bees in the vegetable garden. When attracting bees or pollinators, Travis has a designated flower area that has three different species planted on a double row to ensure he achieves maximum pollination. The first species of flowers planted is the <a href=\"/products/cosmos-versailles-mix/\">Cosmos Versailles Mix</a> which is a cut-flower that is a brightly-colored blend with strong stems that consistently bloom throughout the warmer months. The second species planted is the <a href=\"/products/benary-giant-zinnia-mix/\">Benary Giant Zinnias Mix</a> which has a variety of different colorful flowers that is known for being one of the easiest cut flower varieties to grow. The third species variety is the <a href=\"/products/ageratum-blue-horizon/\">Ageratum Blue Horizon</a> that creates tall, sturdy bloom clusters of vibrant blue or purplish cut-flowers. The reason behind planting these flowers on double rows is Travis is able to get maximum production in small space and he is able to suppress weeds that would otherwise take over the garden area. Travis also has a patch full of Pro-Cut Sunflowers that bees love and attract to in the vegetable garden. He recently planted a mix of several different sunflowers such as the <a href=\"/products/procut-white-nite-sunflower/\">White Nite</a>, <a href=\"/products/procut-lemon-sunflower/\">Lemon</a>, <a href=\"/products/joker-sunflower/\">Joker</a>, <a href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\">Orange</a>, <a href=\"/products/procut-red-lemon-bicolor-sunflower/\">Red Lemon Bicolor</a>, and <a href=\"/products/procut-plum-sunflower/\">Plum</a> all together and planted them using the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. When you direct seed these varieties you are able to get a nice stand of thick sunflowers or flowers in the area. Another benefit of planting the sunflowers so dense is you are able to get a nice stratification which means you achieve blooms that come out at around 5 or 6 inches tall and some at 8 or 9 inches tall.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOjDsBJOQg8&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=21&amp;t=0s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Garden Seeder</h2>\nThe <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> is the ideal tool for planting various different seed sizes and accurately plant seeds without overplanting. This tool is constructed with Amish-crafted hardwood handles that contain 15-inch steel wheels and a powder-coated steel frame. It includes six different plates that vary in size for different seed varieties. The first seed plate works great for crops like broccoli, cabbage, mustard, turnips, and cauliflower. The second seed plate is ideal for crops such as onions or small coated seeds. The third seed plate is for okra and pelleted carrots, beets, or lettuce. While the fourth seed plate is made for smaller sweet corn seeds and the fifth is ideal for small beans or peas. The sixth seed plate that is used with the seeder works best for medium size beans and peas or large corn varieties. The seed plates should lay flat in the hopper to ensure they flow through the seeder properly.\n<h2>Perfectly Spaced Rows</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is planting perfectly spaced rows of okra using the garden seeder. He has a 30 x 35 area that is one of the six subplots that has been established in the dream vegetable garden. When preparing the garden for perfectly spaced rows of okra plants, he is not going to use drip irrigation and is planning to direct seed. Before planting you will need to make sure the seed plate is calibrated correctly for planting and the seeds are flowing properly through the seeder. When using the third seed plate for planting okra it contains six adjustable holes and based on the seeder gearing the seed spacing should be a little over 3 inches. Then, Travis can thin them out around 8 or 12 inches to allow for plenty of room during the growing process. The planting depth for okra should be about half an inch which can be adjusted on the depth gauge located on the seeder. Travis is going to use his <a href=\"/products/garden-seeder-row-marker/\">row marker</a> accessory for the seeder to ensure he gets straight planting lines in the vegetable garden. The row marker has several different spacing options and it can extend out to 36 inches or 3 feet. The row marker is going to fit and slide inside the groove that is located on the back of the garden seeder frame. Travis uses the row marker for the first row to achieve a perfectly spaced row and the rest of the rows should be straight following the first. When planting with the garden seeder a slow and steady pace is the best to ensure you get accurate seed planting. Overall, summer planting is the ideal time to grow a maximum crop of okra that is able to withstand the hottest temperatures.\n<h2>Okra Varieties</h2>\nThe several different okra varieties that we have available are all excellent in production and flavor profiles. The first variety is the <a href=\"/products/jambalaya-okra/\">Jambalaya</a> which is a hybrid that produces the most productive okra in the vegetable garden. Next, is the <a href=\"/products/red-burgundy-okra/\">Red Burgundy</a> which is another excellent variety that produces deep red pods that remain tender when growing longer pod lengths. The <a href=\"/products/silver-queen-okra/\">Silver Queen</a> is an heirloom variety that creates light green pods that are almost white. Another heirloom variety is the <a href=\"/products/cowhorn-okra/\">Cowhorn Okra</a> that makes slender pods that remain tender even when grown at 6 to 10 inches long. However, the <a href=\"/products/star-of-david-okra/\">Star of David</a> variety is the go-to okra for frying because of it’s thicker pods and the <a href=\"/products/clemson-spineless-okra/\">Clemson Spineless</a> produces pods that can reach 7 to 9 inches in length and be harvested between 3 to 4 inches long. The newest okra variety that is now available is the <a href=\"/products/perkins-long-pod-okra/\">Perkins Long Pod</a> which is an heirloom that creates elongated pods that tend to produce early in the vegetable garden.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJPsbHy_NiA&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=22&amp;t=161s",

    "body_html": "<h2>Summer Planting: Sweet Potatoes</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is talking about how to plant and take care of sweet potatoes throughout the growing process. As a warm-weather crop, sweet potatoes are ideal for growing during the summer months because they love the hotter weather and don't mind when it is dry. In the South, summer planting sweet potatoes can be anytime in May till late August. They typically take around 100 to 120 days to mature, therefore, you will need a 3 to 4 month window of time for summer planting. Once you harvest some of the spring crops from the garden we recommend to follow up the area by starting summer planting with sweet potatoes. Unlike Irish potatoes, we plant sweet potatoes from slips which are basically a sprout from the potato that you plunk off. It contains roots on the side that once planted in the ground it will start growing leaves and start bushing out from there. You can grow your own slips from sweet potatoes that were harvested previously in the garden. However, Travis recommends buying sweet potato slips from <a href=\"https://www.sweetpotatoplant.com/\">Steele Plant Company</a> based in Gleason, Tennessee. When choosing a spot for planting sweet potatoes they will need plenty of room because they are a vining crop and tend to sprawl all around the soil surface. If you happen to plant the potatoes to close to another crop they will start to climb on the other crops and end up smothering them out. Once the rows are laid off using the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">wheel hoe</a>, Travis will add good compost along the planting furrows before summer planting. When planting the slips they should be spaced about a foot apart in the vegetable garden. Instead of planting the slips up and down, Travis is going to plant them in the furrow horizontally and cover up almost the entire slip, leaving only a little bit sticking out. Another factor when planting sweet potatoes is they do not have to be planted on drip tape since they do not need a ton of irrigation throughout the growing season. Instead of using drip tape, Travis is going to use overhead watering to ensure he provides the plants with the needed amount of irrigation. For the first couple of days, the plants will look rather pitiful and will begin to perk up once the roots are established in the soil. Once the vines start to become more prevalent in the area you can begin to hill the sweet potatoes or throw soil to the middle of the plant rows. Travis has not found where hilling the plants makes a significant difference, but it is a great technique for weed suppression or smothering out the weeds in the garden. Another technique that he has tried is trimming back the vines as they continue to grow during the summer planting months. Travis found that when trimming the vines back it makes it easier to harvest the sweet potatoes from the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Sweet Potato Varieties</h2>\nThere are several different sweet potato varieties that do well in the vegetable garden. Travis has grown a couple of different potato varieties such as Beauregard and Centennial. He mentions that the sweet potato variety that does the best in production in his garden is the Covington. However, upon recommendation from Steele, Travis is going to plant the Georgia Jets which is supposed to grow really well in the south. All of these sweet potato varieties have excellent storage life and are ideal for summer planting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpI-jhg3akk&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=23&amp;t=66s",

    "title": "Replenishing the Garden Soil Using Cover Crops",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:25-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Benefits of Replenishing Garden Soil</h2>\nTo have improved garden soils using cover crops can help replenish the area by increasing organic matter, suppress nematode populations, control weed germination, and improve overall soil tilth. When building up the garden soils you should supply the best cover crop that fulfills the characteristics you are wanting to replenish in the soil and incorporate the needed compounds back into the soil properly to better fulfill the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Cover Crop: Sunn Hemp</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is discussing the best cover crop to use when you need to replenish the garden soil. The best warm-season cover crop that adds many benefits to the garden soil is known as <a href=\"/products/sunn-hemp/\">Sunn Hemp</a>. This variety is a legume which means it is related to crops like peas and peanuts. This cover crop allows you to add a significant amount of nitrogen, suppress weeds, and quality organic matter into the garden soil. However, compared to other warm-season varieties the Sunn Hemp is the only nitrogen fixer cover crop. As a nitrogen fixer, it is able to grab nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into your garden soil. This fixer is important in the garden because when you get rid of the cover crop you will gain lots of available nitrogen for the next vegetable crop you plant in that area. Some recent studies have shown that Sunn Hemp can fix up to 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre which is excellent when planting heavy feeder crops like onions and corn. Sunn Hemp should be planted when soil temperatures are around 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When planting it can be broadcasted or with a precision planter like the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">garden seeder</a>. This warm-season cover crop grows extremely fast and typically reaches maturity in 8 to 12 weeks. This cover crop variety is pretty much maintenance-free and does not take a lot of effort to grow in the area. Since it grows so quickly it suppresses weed pressures by outpacing weed germination which is a major benefit in the vegetable garden. Like all cover crops, Sunn Hemp should be cut or mowed before it reaches seed to prevent reseeding issues in the future growing seasons.\n<h2>Warm Season Cover Crop Varieties</h2>\nAlong with Sunn Hemp, there are three other cover crop varieties that we have available that beneficial characteristics for the garden soil as well. The <a href=\"/products/brown-top-millet/\">Brown Top Millet</a> provides ideal ground cover for weed suppression and for adding organic matter back into the soil. This tall bunching grass can reach up to 12 feet high and usually matures within 60 to 70 days. As a millet, this green manure can add a significant amount of organic matter to depleted soils which can improve soil quality and tilth. Next, is <a href=\"/products/buckwheat/\">Buckwheat</a> which is another fast-growing cover crop that is ideal for planting in small windows between fall and spring plantings. It works best for weed suppression and provides organic matter that helps loosen up the topsoil making it more workable and increases soil drainage for planting. The best warm-season cover crop for reducing nematode populations is <a href=\"/products/sorghum-sudangrass/\">Sorghum Sudangrass</a>. As a bunching grass, the sudangrass creates a dense mat of tall vegetation similar to corn, but with smaller leaf blades. When mowing down or decomposing the cover crop vegetation it releases natural compounds that are suppressive to nematode populations. We recommend using the sudangrass as a transition crop between spring and fall planting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssj-mgz02Kg&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=24&amp;t=34s",

    "title": "Will This Vegetable Garden Ever Produce Any Crops?",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:24-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>The Dream Vegetable Garden</h2>\nEvery gardener imagines having a dream vegetable garden that is designed and laid out to fit your ideal gardening needs on the homestead. This past year, Travis has established a new area on his homestead that is designed as his dream vegetable garden. The dream garden is designed with six subplots that are all around 30 x 35 in size. The subplots are important to ensure that the area can be more manageable and workable. Another benefit of subplots is the ability to move crops around the plots to establish a steady crop rotation system and avoid harsh pest and disease pressures.\n<h2>Producing Any Crops in the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis is doing a walk around the dream garden to show whether any crops are growing or working well in the area. Since the dream vegetable garden is a new area that is being managed and worked on the soil is harder to work with because it has never been used to grow any crops on. To get the area more workable, Travis will need to grow some beneficial cover crops, add some organic matter, and adjust the pH levels in the soil. The first subplot that was planted on in the vegetable garden was potatoes. Since it was the first crop to be planted he has already harvested and stored all the early varieties of potatoes such as the red potatoes, purple, and the <a href=\"/products/yukon-gold-potato/\">Yukon Gold</a>. However, in the garden area, there are still three rows of <a href=\"/products/german-butterball-potato/\">German Butterball</a> potatoes to be harvested. As the potato varieties are harvested, Travis comes in with the tiller to level out the soil after digging potatoes so it will be prepared for the next crop to be planted soon. On the second plot, all of the cucurbits are planted such as summer squash and cucumbers. The summer squash is planted in the middle, while the cucumbers are planted on the cattle panels along the outside of the plot. In the garden, there is one row of the <a href=\"/products/calypso-cucumber/\">Calypso</a> pickling cucumbers and one row of the <a href=\"/products/stonewall-cucumber/\">Stonewall</a> variety which is slicing cucumbers. The summer squash have done well in the plot except for a few that were lost due to disease problems that need to be controlled better in the future. However, Travis has been able to harvest a pretty good amount of summer squash and cucumbers from the vegetable garden. In the next plot, he has <a href=\"/products/rattlesnake-pole-bean/\">Rattlesnake Pole Beans</a> on a trellis as well as indeterminate and determinate tomatoes. The <a href=\"/products/sun-gold-tomato/\">Sun Gold</a> tomatoes are producing an excellent cluster of tomatoes at the base of the plant and are continuing to produce along the rows. Travis has three rows of determinate tomatoes such as <a href=\"/products/mountain-glory-tomato/\">Mountain Glory</a>, <a href=\"/products/brickyard-tomato/\">Brickyard</a>, and <a href=\"/products/bella-rosa-tomato/\">Bella Rosa</a> varieties all on the Florida Weave trellis. In the south, it can be kind of tough to grow tomatoes because of the high disease pressures, but they are producing really well so far in the vegetable garden. In the fourth plot, Travis is growing peppers and eggplants which are part of the nightshade family. He just established new stakes for trellising and added wheat straw to help manage the weed pressures. While in the fifth plot there is <a href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\">Incredible Sweet Corn</a> growing and the six plot contains winter squash which includes the <a href=\"/products/small-wonder-spaghetti-squash/\">Small Wonder Spaghetti</a> and the <a href=\"/products/hai-kabocha-squash/\">Hai Kabocha</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LhWQoLXlrw&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=25&amp;t=7s",

    "title": "How to Adjust Your Wheel Hoe Handles to Fit You",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:23-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Wheel Hoe Handles</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains how to adjust wheel hoe handles to fit you perfectly. The new accessory that makes it easy to adjust the wheel hoe handles is the <a href=\"/products/offset-handle-bracket/\">offset handle brackets</a>. The handle bracket kit allows you to shift the wheel hoe or garden seeder handles to the left or right so you don't have to work directly behind the tool. This offset handle kit works with the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe,</a> <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a>, <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a>, and the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Garden Seeder</a>. The first step to installing the offset brackets you simply remove the handles that are already on the wheel hoe or seeder by using a 7/16 wrench. Once the handles are off we can install the offset brackets by aligning them with the slotted groove that is already established which allows us to move the handles up and down and still have the functionality needed with the tool. Travis simply takes the bolts that are included with the kit and installs the offset brackets so they can either kick out to the right or left. It is important not to tighten the bolts all the way down because he still wants to figure out where his handle height needs to be. Then, once the handles are installed we can adjust the handles to our desired height and tighten the bolts on the offset brackets. Another important thing to remember when installing the offset handles is to make sure the brackets are kicking out in the same direction to ensure the handles are going to match up. When the offset brackets are installed it is time to add the handles in the top slots of the brackets. Travis is going to use the two square spots because he does not want the handles too far back on the wheel hoe or seeder. However, if you do want the handles farther back you can use the diamond-shaped spots on the bracket. Once the handles are added to the brackets and tight, then he can tighten down the bolts to set his handle height. When everything is set up it is time to place it in the garden and get to work along the rows.\n<h2>Handle Types</h2>\nThe three different types of wheel hoe handles that we offer are the pistol grip, steam-bent, and stock plow handles. The <a href=\"/products/pistol-grip-handles/\">Pistol Grip Handles</a> are designed with a fat end so the handle fits directly in the palm of your hand for pushing the tool through the garden soil. However, the <a href=\"/products/steam-bent-handles/\">Steam Bent Handles</a> have a design that features a curved end to the handles that lets you grip and squeeze the entire handle in your hand. While the <a href=\"/products/stock-plow-handles/\">Stock Plow Handles</a> are used to maneuver or fit into most horse-drawn implements and other gardening equipment such as a disk harrow cultivator. All of these handles are Amish-crafted and made out of hardwood ash that will last a long time on the homestead.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPuh3zi7L24&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=26&amp;t=276s",

    "title": "Everything You Need to Know for Growing Sweet Corn",
    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:23-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Incredible Sweet Corn Variety</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the many different tasks of growing sweet corn. Travis previously planted a sweet corn variety known as <a href=\"/products/incredible-sweet-corn/\">Incredible</a> which is sugary enhanced that has a higher sugar content than other standard varieties allowing it to have excellent flavor profiles. Another benefit of this variety is it contains a great disease package and improved storage than older heirloom varieties. He planted the sweet corn using the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Garden Seeder</a> and spaced them about 4 to 6 inches apart since they were planted on drip tape.\n<h2>Hilling, Side-Dressing, &amp; Fertilizing Sweet Corn</h2>\nThe first major reason behind hilling sweet corn is for weed suppression. By using the <a href=\"/products/double-wheel-hoe/\">Double Wheel Hoe</a> and cultivating between the rows of corn you are able to keep the weeds down. By smothering out the weeds between the plants you are reducing weed pressures because they cannot get sunlight or continue to grow and will end up dying in the garden. The second reason for hilling sweet corn is for better plant stabilization. By throwing soil up around the sweet corn it ensures that the plants are stabilized and it will be less likely that harsh wind or rain will cause your crops to lean over. It also allows the roots to grip into the soil a little bit better throughout the growing sweet corn process. The third reason for hilling is for better side-dressing and applying granular fertilizer to the sweet corn. When it comes to side-dressing corn the first step is to simply apply granular fertilizer to the side of the plants along the garden row. Then, take a wheel hoe and cover the fertilizer up while throwing soil to the corn for plant stabilization and weed suppression. The ideal tool for hilling is the <a href=\"/products/high-arch-wheel-hoe/\">High Arch Wheel Hoe</a> with the <a href=\"/products/wheel-hoe-walk-behind-plow-set/\">plow set</a> attachment in the hilling position. The high arch has a gap or space between the two toolbars and the wheels which allows you to easily straddle the rows to throw soil to both sides of the plants in one pass through along the rows. Another benefit to this wheel hoe is the 15-inch clearance that allows you to straddle even the taller plants as they continue to grow. When it comes to the fertilizer or mainly nitrogen requirements for sweet corn it is recommended that 250 lbs per acre of nitrogen is needed throughout the life of the plant. However, since most gardeners are growing sweet corn on a smaller acre, Travis suggests about 5.7 lbs of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet. Travis recommends spoon-feeding throughout the entire life of the plant, therefore instead of giving them five and a half pounds of nitrogen at one time he will break that up and give them around half increments about 4 to 5 times. Travis uses three sources of nitrogen when growing sweet corn which is chicken manure, Chilean nitrate, and 20-20-20 garden fertilizer. He places the chicken manure compost down beside the plants for his first nitrogen application. For the second spoon-feeding he will use the <a href=\"/products/chilean-nitrate-fertilizer/\">Chilean Nitrate</a> as a side-dress because it is a natural source of high nitrogen and it has a little granulated form that makes it easier to sprinkle around the plants. For a 1,000 square foot plot if the entire bag of Chilean nitrate is used it will give the area 1.5 pounds of actual nitrogen which is just the right amount for spoon-feeding sweet corn. All that's left is to provide three pounds of nitrogen using the <a href=\"/products/20-20-20-garden-fertilizer/\">20-20-20</a> garden fertilizer. Travis simply uses the 20-20-20 in the <a href=\"/products/ez-flo-fertilizer-injector/\">fertilizer injector</a> which runs through the drip system in the vegetable garden. Overall, when growing sweet corn is very important to hill, side-dress, and fertilize throughout the growing stages of corn to ensure you get maximum production and healthy plants.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r21qLanfkM&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=27&amp;t=106s",

    "created_at": "2023-06-06T23:46:22-04:00",
    "body_html": "<h2>Why Plant Cut Flowers in the Vegetable Garden?</h2>\nThere are a couple of different benefits behind interplanting cut flowers such as sunflowers in the vegetable garden. The first benefit is it will increase the presence of beneficial insects which helps control harmful pests from taking over the area. However, the most important reason for interplanting flowers is it will increase the presence of pollinators and maximize the number of healthy plants producing along the rows. This will in return give us a bountiful harvest of healthy crops in the vegetable garden.\n<h2>Planting Sunflowers in the Garden</h2>\nOn this week's episode, Travis explains the best way to plant sunflowers in the vegetable garden area. Travis has grown ProCut sunflower varieties for around 4 to 5 years. When planting sunflowers the best tool to use is the <a href=\"/products/hoss-garden-seeder/\">Hoss Garden Seeder</a> which comes with adjustable seed plates that make planting different seed sizes easy along the row. To get the perfect seed plate for planting ProCut varieties Travis simply takes an existing seed plate and modifies it to match the seed size of the sunflower variety. The seed plate he is using to plant has 6 holes which are a little over 3 inches in spacing since Travis prefers to plant sunflowers thick. Once the seed plate is customized to your preferred hole spacing and seed size it is time to ensure the seeds are running through the seed plate properly within the seeder. Before planting with the seeder, Travis must take the <a href=\"/products/hoss-wheel-hoe/\">Single Wheel Hoe</a> with a 12-inch <a href=\"/products/oscillating-hula-hoe/\">oscillating hoe</a> to cultivate the area a couple of inches and make the area more workable prior to planting sunflower seeds. When planting the seeds he places them around 2 to 3 feet apart and is going to use overhead watering instead of drip tape in the garden.\n<h2>Sunflower Varieties</h2>\nProCut sunflowers are the preferred variety of sunflower that is used by all the professional cut flower gardeners. These sunflower varieties will reach around 6 to 7 feet tall and each plant produces a single stem or one flower in the garden. Another benefit of the ProCut varieties of sunflowers is they are pollen-less which means they don't have any pollen. Therefore, when you harvest the sunflowers and place them in a vase they will not deposit pollen all over the place like traditional sunflowers. There are 6 different color variation varieties that we have available this year. The first variety is the <a href=\"/products/procut-orange-sunflower/\">ProCut Orange</a> which produces bright orange petals with dark brown disk center. Next, is the <a href=\"/products/procut-lemon-sunflower/\">ProCut Lemon</a> which creates beautiful lemon-colored petals similar to the traditional yellow sunflower. Another unusual pretty variety is the <a href=\"/products/procut-red-lemon-bicolor-sunflower/\">ProCut Red Lemon Bicolor</a> which is a bicolor that has red to yellow petals. The <a href=\"/products/procut-white-nite-sunflower/\">White Nite</a> produces solid vanilla-colored petals that make the vegetable garden pop with color. The fifth variety we offer is a <a href=\"/products/procut-red-sunflower/\">ProCut Red</a> which contains deep burgundy petals. While the last variety we have available is the <a href=\"/products/procut-plum-sunflower/\">ProCut Plum</a> which is another bicolor that creates plum to cream-colored petals.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wPSIReXZYU&amp;list=PLpE5HGhzrST92VQKjbC-jp9w4HJ4JjMVs&amp;index=28&amp;t=0s",
